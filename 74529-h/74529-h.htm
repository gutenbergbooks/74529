<p class='c002'><em>The South African veld, with its gentle rolling hills and soft
green meadows watered by many streams, is the background for
this unusual story about Nomusa, daughter of a Zulu chief.</em></p>

<p class='c003'><em>Nomusa is warmhearted and generous and affectionate; she
loves all her little brothers and sisters and enjoys helping to care
for them. But she is strong and brave and daring, too; she feels
that girls’ work is dull and boys’ work is much more exciting,
and much more fun.</em></p>

<p class='c003'><em>More than anything else, Nomusa yearns to go with the
men on the annual elephant hunt. But she knows this is impossible.
As her mother says</em>, “<em>Girls</em> never <em>go on elephant hunts!</em>”</p>

<p class='c003'><em>After Nomusa’s adventure with a fierce wild boar, her father,
Chief Zitu, rewards her bravery. In a final climax, Nomusa realizes
that being a girl has its own rewards.</em></p>

<p class='c003'><em>A sympathetic, engrossing story about a primitive civilization
of today. Nomusa is a heroine whom girls will envy and boys
will admire.</em></p>

  <h2 class='c009'><span class='fss'>ONE</span>: A Morning Adventure</h2>
</div>

<p class='c002'>Although it was morning, inside the straw
hut it was still dark. Nomusa lay on her little bamboo
mat, stretching and scratching her lean, naked body. She
yawned and thought to herself:</p>

<p class='c003'>Yo, I am still so sleepy! If only I did not have to get
up to fetch water from the stream! Why must I leave my
comfortable mat when Mdingi and Kangata may still
sleep? Zulu boys have all the fun, and they don’t work
nearly so hard as the girls.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa rolled up her mat, moving quietly so as
not to wake her baby sister and her little brother. They
lay sleeping on a larger mat next to her mother,
Makanya.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>As Nomusa passed the iron pot, she picked out a
piece of cold sweet potato to eat on the way to the
stream. Taking a clay jar in one hand and holding the
sweet potato in the other, she crawled out of the low
opening of her hut.</p>

<p class='c003'>Coming out from the darkness of the hut into the
brilliant sunshine made Nomusa’s eyes blink. She took
a deep breath of the fresh air. What a wonderful day!</p>

<p class='c003'>She stood for a moment looking about the kraal.
There were six other huts in the enclosure, each shaped
like a huge beehive. Five belonged to the five other
wives of Nomusa’s father. The sixth hut, which was the
biggest, was where her father, Chief Zitu, lived. The
seven huts were in a circle on a hillside overlooking a
wide, lovely valley.</p>

<p class='c003'>As Nomusa stood there she saw no sign of anyone
stirring in the other huts. Usually she saw some of her
half sisters, many of whom were about the same age as
herself, crawling out of their huts to go for water too. It
was more fun going together. But today Nomusa’s father
was coming to visit their hut, and everything had to be
ready earlier than usual.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>She left the kraal and walked quickly down the
well-worn dirt path leading to a clear stream in the
valley. As she hurried along, Nomusa looked toward
one of the other hills to see if any smoke was coming
from the kraal of their nearest neighbor. Yes, there was
a thin wisp of smoke curling up from a hut. That meant
some of them were already awake and cooking. Nomusa
wondered if the smoke were coming from Damasi’s hut.
There was much work to be done in his kraal, too; for
tomorrow all the children from Nomusa’s kraal would
go to a party in Damasi’s.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_011.jpg' alt='[Huts]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c003'>For a moment Nomusa forgot she was in a hurry
and stood there thinking as she chewed the last bit of
sweet potato. She gazed dreamily into the soft green
meadows of the valley, encircled by rolling hills and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>watered by many little streams. It was the season after
the heavy rains, and now the mimosa trees were covered
with yellow blossoms and feathery green leaves. The
thorn bushes looked softer with their new thick foliage.
In some of the trees orchids, green and brown, clung
to branches by their thick stems. The sandhills beyond,
usually so bare, were now blanketed with grass and wild
flowers so that one hardly knew there were jagged
rocks beneath.</p>

<p class='c003'>With the water jar on her left hip and her right arm
hanging loosely by her side, Nomusa looked like an
ebony statue, her body slim and strong, her hair a mass
of short black curls covering her head. She looked as
much like a boy as a girl. Her snub nose and smiling
mouth were only a little different from those of her
father’s other children, but there was something special
about her intelligent brown eyes.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa hurried to make up for stopping, and
reached the swollen stream in the valley warm and out
of breath. What if her father arrived in their hut before
she returned with the water? What a disgrace that
would be!</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>She began sloshing her jar back and forth in the
stream to fill it. Much as she wanted to, she would not
take time now for a dip in the water. Perhaps there
would be time for a swim when she came for water
again at noon.</p>

<p class='c003'>No sound broke the morning calm except the
gentle splashing and sloshing of the water as Nomusa
pulled her jar from one side to another. Then a sudden
screech coming from one of the trees overhanging the
stream made Nomusa look up. Above her head she saw
two parrots sitting side by side. Their brilliant feathers
bristled stiffly, and they shifted uneasily on the branch.
What was worrying them, she wondered?</p>

<p class='c003'>The parrots flapped their wings, and again they
screeched, this time more insistently. A long scarlet
feather slowly fluttered to the ground, and Nomusa
dashed out of the stream to catch it before it landed.
She did not want it to get wet and bedraggled on the
moist ground.</p>

<p class='c003'>But it was not easy to clamber over the rocks and
stones. The feather fell into the deep grass beneath the
tree before she could catch it.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>Just as she was about to grasp it, there was a shriek
from the parrots and a loud hiss. Nomusa jumped back
and almost fell into the stream as she stumbled against
a tree stump. She jumped up on the stump and looked
fearfully down into the grass to see what had hissed
at her.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was the imamba, one of the most dreaded snakes.
Its body was a bright flame color; as she watched, the
creature raised its head from the ground and spread out
the brilliant skin on its neck so that it looked as if it had
a hood.</p>

<p class='c003'>The imamba turned toward Nomusa and hissed
again. Nomusa knew that this meant the snake was
about to strike. She could see its short fangs, its back-curved
teeth. Its lidless eyes were round and cold and
cruel.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa broke into a cold sweat as she saw the
snake’s long, slender tongue, forked at the end, waving
like an antenna to detect the odors and vibrations in the
air. The imamba was looking for her so that when he
spat his poison at her he would make a direct hit. She
knew just how he would do it.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>He would throw his body forward, and two jets of
his venom would shoot out from the ends of his fangs. If
this poison reached so much as scratch on her skin, it
could kill her. If it got into her eyes, it would blind her,
perhaps forever.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_015.jpg' alt='[Girl]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c003'>There was a large stone nearby, but Nomusa knew
that her people never killed snakes, no matter how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>dangerous they were. Snakes were full of evil spirits that
would avenge themselves on the killer.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa wanted to run, but she knew better.
Instead, she stood without the slightest movement, so
as to keep the snake from striking. The imamba swayed
his head slightly in a rhythmical motion that made
Nomusa almost dizzy as she watched.</p>

<p class='c003'>How long, she wondered, would they remain staring
at each other before something happened? If she
made the least move now, the imamba would surely
strike. A few drops of sweat oozed down her nose and
made the tip of it itchy, but Nomusa dared not lift a
finger to scratch it.</p>

<p class='c003'>The parrots had now grown unusually still, as if
they were watching the outcome of the contest. Why did
they no longer shriek or screech? All at once there was a
swift blur of an object that flew to one side of the imamba,
causing the snake to turn quickly in that direction.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa made a mighty spring from the stump,
landing in the stream with such a noisy splash that the
water rose over her in foaming bubbles.</p>

<p class='c003'>She was safe!</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'><span class='fss'>TWO</span>: A House with One Room</h2>
</div>

<p class='c002'>When she returned with the water,
Nomusa saw her little brother Themba rolling in the
dust in front of their hut. His chubby body was covered
with dirt, and he looked like a brown gingerbread boy
covered with gray powdered sugar.</p>

<p class='c003'>“What a story I have for you, Themba!”</p>

<p class='c003'>But Themba spied the water jar. “I want a drink.
Give me a drink! Give me a drink, Nomusa!”</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa brought the edge of the water jar to her
small brother’s eager lips. Water ran down his chin and
over his fat body as he drank noisily.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa’s dog, Puleng, came running out of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>hut. He showed his happiness at seeing Nomusa by
running around her in crazy circles.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Thirsty, Puleng?” Nomusa cupped her hand and
poured some water into it for the dog to drink.</p>

<p class='c003'>Just then Nomusa heard a voice behind her.</p>

<p class='c003'>“<i><span lang="zu">Sakubona</span></i>, Nomusa!”</p>

<p class='c003'>It was her half sister, Sisiwe, who lived in the hut
next to Nomusa’s. They had the same father but not the
same mother.</p>

<p class='c003'>“What is the story, Nomusa?” Themba broke in
eagerly. If his sisters began talking, he might never
hear it.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well,” Nomusa began, showing them the beautiful
red and green feather, “it all began with this.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Sisiwe exclaimed over the parrot feather, but
Themba clamored for the story.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa described her encounter with the imamba
with lively words and gestures. Her audience was much
impressed.</p>

<p class='c003'>“And you went back for the feather!” said Sisiwe.
“I should never have dared.</p>

<p class='c003'>“You are lucky to have escaped—and to have the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>beautiful feather,” Sisiwe said, touching it admiringly.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I have something else,” added Nomusa. She
opened the little deerskin bag that hung about her neck.
This bag was her only pocket, and into it went all
Nomusa’s small treasures.</p>

<p class='c003'>She took out a golden-yellow pebble, smooth and
round, about the size of her thumbnail.</p>

<p class='c003'>“How lovely!” Sisiwe exclaimed. “Where did you
get it?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I found it on the ground as I returned from
the stream.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“The most exciting things always happen to you,
Nomusa,” Sisiwe said. “How did you happen to be so
early today?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I am early because our father is coming to visit
us today, Sisiwe.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“He visited our hut yesterday. He wore a new belt
of wildcat tails and looked very handsome,” Sisiwe
said proudly.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa was very proud of their father, too. Zitu
was one of the most powerful Zulu chiefs, and head of
the Zulu king’s council. He was rich, rich enough to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>have six wives, and this was why Nomusa was lucky
enough to have thirty brothers and sisters.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I heard our father talking to my mother about
the elephant hunt,” Sisiwe went on. “This time he is
taking some of our older brothers with him.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa’s brown eyes grew big with excitement.
“Oh, Sisiwe, how I should love to go! Do you suppose I
could?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Sisiwe opened her eyes in astonishment. “A girl
go on an elephant hunt? Who ever heard of such a
thing? Why, Nomusa, you talk as if you were our
brother Mdingi!”</p>

<p class='c003'>“It is true that I do not like girls’ work,” Nomusa
said sadly.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Nomusa!” Makanya called out sharply from within
the hut.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I am here, my mother,” answered Nomusa, quickly
crawling through the low opening of the hut. A
delicious smell of food cooking enveloped her as she
entered. Corn mush and bananas were steaming in a
pot over the fire.</p>

<p class='c003'>After the dazzling sunshine outdoors, it took one’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>eyes several seconds to be able to see inside the dark hut.
It was just one large room; on the long pole extending
from one end of the hut to the other hung baskets,
wooden milk pails, gourds, and other things used in the
vegetable gardens.</p>

<p class='c003'>There was a saucerlike hole in the middle of the
floor. Here they made the fire for cooking. Nomusa and
her mother had gone to great trouble to pound a mixture
of ant-heap sand, clay, and cow dung into the dirt
floor, pounding and rubbing it with large smooth stones
so it would gleam and glisten. She hoped her father
would notice that they were good housekeepers.</p>

<p class='c003'>“What kept you so long, my daughter?” asked
Makanya. “I have been waiting for the water. Did you
forget your father is coming to visit us? Stir the fire while
I feed Bala.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa’s mother gently laid the baby on a mat
while she took an earthenware jar from the cool earth
on one side of the room. In this jar was milk that had
been left to sour into thick, large clots. The milk was
cold and curdlike. Then Makanya picked up Bala and
held her on her grass-skirted lap. The fat baby began
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>to coo expectantly, holding up her brown, dimpled
hands to her mother. Like a bird she opened her mouth,
uttering cooing sounds. Makanya slowly poured some
of the clotted milk into the baby’s mouth. Bala began
to smack her lips happily, but suddenly her expression
turned into one of disappointment and disgust. She did
not like her new food, and she would not swallow it, but
began spitting it out as fast as she could. The clotted
milk dribbled over her chin and down her chubby body.</p>

<p class='c003'>But the thick sour clots were good for babies, and
Nomusa’s mother was determined that Bala should
swallow them. She tried again to pour some of the nourishing
clotted milk into the baby’s mouth. This time
Bala held her lips tightly closed.</p>

<p class='c003'>Looking on anxiously, Nomusa thought it a pity
that the baby did not yet have sense enough to know
how good clotted milk tasted. She and her brothers
loved it and did not get it half often enough.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Nomusa!” called her mother. “Hold Bala’s arms.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, Mother, I do not like to do this,” said Nomusa.
She was always unhappy when her little sister cried.</p>

<p class='c003'>Makanya pinched together Bala’s nostrils so that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>she could not breathe. At once the baby opened her
mouth for air, and when she did so, her mother quickly
poured in some of the clotted milk. Bala choked and
spluttered, but finally she had to swallow what was in
her mouth. Frantically she struggled, and tiny as she
was, she showed a strength that grew out of terror and
desperation. She let out a fierce cry of rage which almost
brought tears to Nomusa’s sorrowful eyes.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yo, I am glad that’s over,” said Nomusa.</p>

<p class='c003'>By this time Bala was covered with white splashes,
and some of the clots had fallen on her mother’s skirt.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Here, Puleng!” called Nomusa.</p>

<p class='c003'>Into the hut he came running, followed by Themba,
who was not yet tall enough to have to crawl in through
the low entrance of the hut, but did it to imitate the
older children and to show he was grown up.</p>

<p class='c003'>The dog did not have to be told what he had been
called for. Without delay, he began licking off the milk
splashes from Bala’s naked little body, leaving her skin
smooth and moist. The baby seemed to enjoy the dog’s
warm tongue on her body. It soothed her and made her
forget how miserable she had been.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>“Now the water, Nomusa,” said her mother.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa brought it to her. Her mother took a large
mouthful of the water, held it in her mouth a little until
it was warm, and then squirted it on Bala. She did this
over and over again until the delighted baby was thoroughly
washed. She was then laid on her mother’s mat,
where she promptly stuck two fingers in her mouth and
fell asleep.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_024.jpg' alt='[Mother]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Seeing that the clotted milk jar had not been put
away, Themba begged softly, “I’m hungry, Nomusa.
Me, too.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa poured some of the milk into his mouth.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Here, little greedy. But then you must let me
wash you.”</p>

<p class='c003'>She filled a hollow gourd with water and held it
high over Themba’s head, letting the water trickle over
him. Themba danced up and down holding his hands
over his head and shouting, “It’s raining, it’s raining!”</p>

<p class='c003'>“<i><span lang="zu">Tula!</span></i>” warned his mother. “You’ll wake the
baby.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa began rubbing her hand up and down
his sturdy little body to clean him. She loved all her
little sisters and brothers, even those belonging to Zitu’s
other wives.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’m going to eat now, Themba. Run outdoors.
When I have finished and done some work for mother,
I’ll come and play <i><span lang="zu">Hlungulu</span></i> with you.”</p>

<p class='c003'>This was Themba’s favorite game; so he ran out
of the hut, forgetting in his haste that he should have
crawled out if he was to be thought grown up.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'><span class='fss'>THREE</span>: A Visit from the Chief</h2>
</div>

<p class='c002'>Nomusa took up a little grass basket into
which she put some of the food cooking in the pot.</p>

<p class='c003'>She picked out pieces of corn and banana, putting
them into her mouth and sucking the juice from her
fingers with great relish.</p>

<p class='c003'>As she ate, she watched her mother getting ready
for her husband’s visit. Makanya was busily greasing
her body so she would look clean and shiny.</p>

<p class='c003'>She rubbed her arms, then her legs, then her whole
body, with fresh, sweet-smelling butter. It had been made
the day before from cream from Makanya’s own cows.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Nomusa, when you have finished eating, I should
like you to help me comb my hair.”</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>“I have finished now, my mother.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Then here are the porcupine quill and the comb.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The comb was a wooden one which Makanya had
made herself. “Remember to comb my hair straight
up into a peak,” she said. “Some day when you are
married you will wear your hair the same way.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa combed her mother’s short, thick hair up
from the back of her neck, shaping and slanting it backward
from her forehead. To look proper, the hair had
to end in a peak just back of the top of her head.</p>

<p class='c003'>Every little while Nomusa had to rub grease into
the hair so that it would stand up stiffly and stay in
shape. With the porcupine quill she picked at the hair
to keep the strands in place. It took patience and much
combing and greasing to make the hair stay where it
was supposed to.</p>

<p class='c003'>After a while, Makanya carefully ran her hand
over her head to feel the shape of her hair.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well done, my daughter,” she said.</p>

<p class='c003'>“What skirt will you wear today?” asked Nomusa.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I shall wear the new oxhide one,” said Makanya.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, you will look beautiful!”</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Nomusa knew it was only a very special occasion
that would induce her mother to wear the oxhide skin
instead of her short grass skirt. For days and days she
had watched her mother water-soak the skin, which
had come from one of her own cattle. When it was soft,
she had helped her mother pull out all the hairs. It had
been long and tedious work. After that, they had both
used sharp thorns and scratched and scratched at one
side of the skin until it was as soft as a baby’s ear.</p>

<p class='c003'>Part of the skin became a skirt, part was used for
Nomusa’s best neck-pocket. Another part was used as
a sling in which her mother carried the baby when she
was working in the vegetable garden. The rest of the
skin was saved until it should be needed.</p>

<p class='c003'>Finally Makanya took from the rafters of the hut
some bead bracelets and a necklace she kept hidden
there. These she put on while Nomusa stood to one side,
marveling at her mother’s beauty. Makanya was tall
and well-shaped. Her muscles were firm and strong.
When she laughed, her white teeth glistened, making
her smooth skin look darker still. No wonder Nomusa’s
father had had to give ten cows in order to get her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>mother as a wife. She had heard that none of his other
wives had cost that much.</p>

<p class='c003'>“You are beautiful, my mother!” exclaimed
Nomusa admiringly.</p>

<p class='c003'>Just then they heard the sound of a man clearing
his throat in front of the entrance to the hut.</p>

<p class='c003'>“He is here!” said Makanya excitedly, a slight pink
color appearing under her skin.</p>

<p class='c003'>The small amount of daylight which came into
the hut through the entrance was blocked as a large
figure came crawling in.</p>

<p class='c003'>“<i><span lang="zu">Sakubona</span></i>,” Zitu greeted them, smiling. The Zulu
chief was magnificent in a belt of wildcat tails and a
necklace of blue beads around his neck.</p>

<p class='c003'>“<i><span lang="zu">Usaphila</span></i>,” answered Nomusa and her mother.</p>

<p class='c003'>Always a little shy with her father, Nomusa partly
hid behind her mother.</p>

<p class='c003'>Makanya said, “Nomusa, get your father’s mat.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa got out the new bamboo mat her mother
had made especially for him and unrolled it on the
smooth floor. On this Zitu squatted. He took out of his
belt the horn of an ox and some tobacco. After stuffing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>the horn with the tobacco, he took an ember from the
fire and lit his pipe. Silently he began smoking.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa’s mother now brought out all the good
things she had made for her husband to eat. On a large
grass plate she put chicken, pumpkin, yams, mealies,
roast bananas. Then she brought beer. On Zitu’s lap
Makanya placed some tobacco she had grown especially
for him.</p>

<p class='c003'>At first, Nomusa’s father pretended to be indifferent
to the food, but the tantalizing smells proved
too much for him. He laid down his oxhorn pipe and
began eating with great gusto. He ate noisily, smacking
his lips and belching from time to time. Nomusa and
her mother did not utter a word while he was eating.
They sat quietly, moving only when they had to take
away his empty plate and fill it again. The Zulu chief
ate and ate. Nomusa wondered how he could eat so
much. From time to time an extra loud belch came out
of him. Then Nomusa and her mother exchanged
happy glances. They heard and saw that Zitu was enjoying
their food.</p>

<p class='c003'>Finally he licked his fingers thoroughly, showing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>he had finished. He looked at Nomusa and her mother
smilingly. That was all, but it was enough to make them
feel repaid for all the effort they had gone to in order
to please him.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_031.jpg' alt='[Family]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Zitu sat on his mat, a strong handsome figure. His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>muscular legs looked as though they could walk forty
miles a day easily. Nomusa had heard that he often
walked that much when he was out on a hunt. She
wondered, as she kept her shining eyes on her father,
whether he would say something about the elephant
hunt. She waited and hoped.</p>

<p class='c003'>Suddenly the chief spoke, pointing to the sleeping
baby. “She looks as if she would be worth five cows.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Ay, she will be worth more,” answered Makanya
proudly. “And Nomusa here, who helps me so well, is
worth seven cows already.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Zitu looked at Nomusa appraisingly; then, taking
hold of her firm arm, he said, “She is a strong girl, almost
as big as her older brother. I hear she can do
anything a boy can. If she were a boy, I would take
her on the elephant hunt when we leave at the full
moon.”</p>

<p class='c003'>At the full moon! thought Nomusa, her heart
beating excitedly.</p>

<p class='c003'>Inwardly she began counting the number of days
to the full moon. About ten sleeps away, she said to
herself. There will be time for one more visit from my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>father. How can I make him decide to take me? What
can I do that will prove to him that I am more courageous
than other girls, that I am strong and have
no fear?</p>

<p class='c003'>Half dreaming, she began to leave the hut.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Where are you going, Nomusa?” asked her
mother.</p>

<p class='c003'>“To play <i><span lang="zu">Hlungulu</span></i> with Themba,” she murmured.
“I promised him.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'><span class='fss'>FOUR</span>: Nomusa and Her Brothers</h2>
</div>

<p class='c002'>Hardly had Nomusa’s head appeared at
the entrance of the hut when Themba pounced on it,
trying to get astride her neck, shouting, “My calf wins
the race!”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Get off, Themba!” Nomusa protested, though
she had to laugh at him. “I’m no calf. And who told
you about calf races? They are absolutely forbidden.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Kangata told me. He said they have fun with
calves in the pasture.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“How well I know it!” said Nomusa. “I wish I
could spend my days in the pasture and have as good
a time as my brothers do!”</p>

<p class='c003'>“When I am big, I shall go to the pasture,” said
Themba proudly.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>“Yes,” Nomusa replied. “You are very lucky to be
a boy. Girls’ work is no fun at all.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Play <i><span lang="zu">Hlungulu</span></i>,” begged Themba. “You promised.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Very well, sit down over there,” said Nomusa.
“Now put your feet towards me.</p>

      <div class='line'><em>You will come back at the new moon.</em>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Themba giggled as Nomusa acted out the song
with grimaces and dramatic gestures. Before she had
actually finished he was already begging, “Again,
again!” When she had sung <i><span lang="zu">Hlungulu</span></i> for the third time,
he placed his wide, bare feet on Nomusa’s lap and said,
“Now sing me <em>ta-yi-ya-ne-lo</em>.”</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>Putting her thumb and forefinger on the big toe of
his left foot, she began softly
giving each toe a gentle squeeze. From the beginning
of the song to the end, Themba’s face was one delighted
grin. As soon as she squeezed the last toe, he laughed
and said, “More, Nomusa, more!”</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>At last it was time to stop. Nomusa had to grind
the corn for the mealie mush they would eat later.
Usually it was her mother who ground the corn, because
it took strong arms; but since Nomusa knew her
mother was busy entertaining her father, she decided
to do it for her.</p>

<p class='c003'>She picked up a small round stone lying next to a
larger one which was scooped out in the middle. Into
the scooped-out stone she threw a handful of hard
kernels of corn. Then, using the small round stone like
a rolling-pin and flicking a little water into the hollow
stone, she ground and ground the corn until it became
a coarse corn meal. When it was ground she poured it
into a basket where it would be ready when her mother
needed it for porridge or corn cakes. Part of it would
be brewed for her father’s beer, as well.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/i_037.jpg' alt='[Girl]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa went on pounding and rolling the corn.
She grew tired and wiped off the moisture on her face
with the back of her hand. She wondered how her
mother managed to pound and pound for such long
periods without stopping. As she rested a moment, she
heard someone call, “Yo, Nomusa!”</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>She looked up and saw Sisiwe entering the kraal
with a basket on her head. The green tops of vegetables
showed above the top of the basket.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Tired after the elephant hunt?” teased Sisiwe.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I see you have been weeding your mother’s
garden,” Nomusa remarked, ignoring the teasing.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes,” said Sisiwe. “And now I have to fetch water
again. I’ll never get ready in time for Damasi’s party. I
haven’t even ground my paint yet. Have you?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“No. I’ll go with you to fetch water. Perhaps we’ll
find the right paint stones on the way.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa went back to finish grinding the corn
while Sisiwe carried the basket of beans and sweet
potatoes to her hut.</p>

<p class='c003'>Soon Sisiwe came out again, looking more cheerful.
This time she was carrying an empty water jar and
eating something. Nomusa picked up a jar lying next
to the thatch of her hut and walked over to meet her
half sister, who offered her a piece of melon. Side by
side, one with the water jar on her left hip, the other
with it on her right, the girls proceeded to the stream.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Our father has come,” Nomusa said. “Ay, Sisiwe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>he is as you said. We saw the new belt of wildcat tails.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“And did he speak of the elephant hunt?” asked
Sisiwe.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes,” replied Nomusa unhappily. “He said that
if I were a boy he might have taken me along. If only
I were! He will certainly take my brother, Mdingi.
Well, at least I shall have the fun of taking the cattle
to pasture while he is away, for Kangata is too young
to watch them all by himself.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa began to grow excited at the prospect of
taking the cattle to pasture and for a moment even
thought it would make up for not being allowed to go
on the elephant hunt.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, Nomusa, why must you always be so eager
to do what boys do? You should be content with being
a girl. Girls are worth much more than boys. No Zulu
girl can be had for a wife unless she is paid for in cattle.
We are valuable.”</p>

<p class='c003'>But Nomusa’s mind was no longer on what Sisiwe
was saying. Her eyes were searching the ground to
right and left, seeking the stones with which to make
the paint. Halfway to the stream, Nomusa and Sisiwe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>placed their empty jars under a mimosa tree and left
the path to look for colored stones that were soft enough
to grind.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Here’s a white one,” called Nomusa to her sister.
“And here’s another. If we find two more white ones,
we’ll have enough for white paint.”</p>

<p class='c003'>When they had gathered all the stones they would
need, Sisiwe said: “We’ll leave them here in a pile until
we come back from the stream.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“The water is much lower than it was this morning,”
Nomusa remarked. “How thirsty the sun must be
to drink so much every day. Well, anyway, there’s still
enough for a good dip; and here I go!” In she dived,
the pink soles of her feet gleaming. Sisiwe laughed and
plunged in after her.</p>

<p class='c003'>The two girls began to splash and pull each other
under the water with so much shouting and merriment
that birds nearby grew frightened and flew away. The
monkeys hiding in the boughs lifted their heads and
stared in wonder as the girls played in the water.</p>

<p class='c003'>After a while, Nomusa and Sisiwe filled their jars
with water and covered them with leaves from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>bushes. They placed a cushion of rushes on top of their
heads before balancing the jars on their heads. Then
they rose carefully, first one knee, then the other, without
spilling a single drop.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_041.jpg' alt='[Children]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c003'>When they reached the spot where they had left
their paint stones, the girls picked them up one by one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>with their nimble toes, passing them to their hands.</p>

<p class='c003'>When they got to their kraal, Nomusa and Sisiwe
left the water in their huts. Then they sat in an open
space near the huts, with their piles of stones before
them. With a hard stone they pounded the soft red,
black, and white stones, putting the different colors in
separate piles, on leaves. Umpondo, Sisiwe’s little
brother, only a few days older than Themba, sat between
his sisters, picking up the little pieces of soft
stone as they pounded away. Nomusa said to him, “You
may have some of the stones if you wish, little brother,”
and she pushed some of them toward him.</p>

<p class='c003'>The soft paint stones crumbled to bits easily as
Nomusa crushed and pounded them. After the pieces
were small enough, she ground them until they were
fine as dust. Nomusa and Sisiwe worked silently for a
time. Then Umpondo said, “Nomusa, Themba said
you know good stories. Do you know about Uthlakanyana?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, yes,” said Nomusa. “Mdingi has told me
many stories about that dwarf and his magic. I don’t
know which one to tell you.”</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>“Any one,” begged Umpondo.</p>

<p class='c003'>Without stopping what she was doing, Nomusa
began, “<i><span lang="zu">Za puma zenke izilwane, za li dhla; la ngobuhlunga
bezinyoka, nezinyosi, naofezela neninyovu. La kala, lakala ke,
la ze la fa</span></i>.... Once upon a time Uthlakanyana took a
bag to the forest. Inside of it he had a giant cannibal
whom he had fought and defeated. As he walked along
he found a snake, then a wasp, then a scorpion. All these
biting and poisonous things he put into the bag with
the giant. The giant said, ‘Let me out, let me out. They
are biting me.’ They bit and bit him until he died. So
he died.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Do you know any others?” asked Umpondo
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes, but not now.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa had now finished grinding her stones. She
looked at her three little mounds of red, black, and
white powder. “That’s done,” she said to Sisiwe. “We
shall have enough to paint our whole bodies.” Then
she called out, “Look! Our brothers are already returning
from the pasture. <span lang="zu"><em>Hau!</em> Mdingi, Kangata!</span>”</p>

<p class='c003'>Her own brothers were the last of the boys leading
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>their mothers’ cows and calves into the cattlefold
inside the kraal. This was fenced off from the circle of
huts by a thick wall of boughs and twigs. All the drainage
from the huts flowed down to the cattlefold which
was on the lower side of the sloping hill where the kraal
was situated. In this cattlefold were also the mealie and
grain pits where the corn was stored by the various
wives after it had been stripped from the cobs. Nomusa’s
mother had told her that the fluids from the cattle percolated
into the ground and turned the corn and grain
sour. This prevented the weevils from eating it up.</p>

<p class='c003'>As Nomusa proudly watched her mother’s cows
walking single file into the cattlefold, she noticed that
her mother’s favorite, Nyawuza, was not among them.</p>

<p class='c003'>Where could she be?</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa ran toward the cattlefold just as her
brothers were entering it.</p>

<p class='c003'>Mdingi saw her and called, “Go back, Nomusa!
You know it’s bad luck for girls to be here when we milk
the cows.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes, I know,” Nomusa answered, looking at the
cows to make sure she was not mistaken. “But did you
bring back all of our mother’s cows? I do not see
Nyawuza.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Kangata stood next to Mdingi, looking solemn. Silently
he gazed at his elder brother and sister. Mdingi’s
face was a study of misery and fear.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_044.jpg' alt='[Men]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa knew something serious had happened.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>
<img src='images/i_046.jpg' alt='[Huts]' class='ig001'>
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'><span class='fss'>FIVE</span>: A Lost Cow</h2>
</div>

<p class='c002'>At first Mdingi stood silent. Then he
confessed.</p>

<p class='c003'>“While we were resting after playing games, I began
to think about a song. Sometimes when I do that
I forget about everything else. It was like that today.
When I looked for the cows, they had wandered off. I
ran to drive them back, but I could not find Nyawuza.
I left Kangata with the others while I searched for her. I
looked and whistled until we had to come home. But I
could not find the cow.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“It is my fault, too,” Kangata said, stoutly. “I fell
asleep. Oh, this is the worst thing that could happen!
When Tahle lost a calf once he was punished severely.”</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>Nomusa felt very sorry for her brothers, especially
for Mdingi. Kangata might be scolded, but the cows
were Mdingi’s responsibility. If Nyawuza were not
found, he would certainly be punished for his carelessness.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was especially bad because Nomusa knew that
their father frowned on Mdingi more often than on any
of his children. Zitu himself was very strong and brave,
and a great warrior and hunter. He was often disappointed
in Mdingi. It was no secret that Mdingi liked
making up songs and telling stories more than anything
else.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa’s heart filled with pity as she saw Mdingi’s
misery. She began to think of what might be done.</p>

<p class='c003'>“If we wait till morning, Nyawuza may be killed
by some animal. That would be a disgrace for you always,
Mdingi.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“It is true,” Mdingi acknowledged dejectedly.</p>

<p class='c003'>“She must be found,” Nomusa declared. “I shall
go right away to look for her.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“But, Nomusa, it is growing dark! You would not
be safe. Some wild animal might attack you!”</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>“I must find Nyawuza,” Nomusa said firmly.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Then I shall go with you,” said Mdingi.</p>

<p class='c003'>“No, no! You must milk the cows. And say nothing
about this. Our father is in our hut now; if he hears
what has happened he will be very angry. My work is
finished; I shall not be missed.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I cannot let you go alone,” Mdingi protested.
“Nyawuza knows my whistle.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Show me how you whistle,” directed Nomusa.</p>

<p class='c003'>Mdingi whistled, and Nomusa imitated him. After
a few tries she could do it exactly like Mdingi. Here is
one more thing Nomusa can do as well as I, Mdingi
thought bitterly. She should have been the boy.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Do not say anything about the lost cow,” Nomusa
cautioned. “Tomorrow is the day of Damasi’s party,
and we might not be allowed to go.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Out of the kraal flew Nomusa like a small wild
thing, her neck pocket bouncing as she ran. Her brothers
watched her go, now worried about Nomusa as
well as the cow.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I should not have let her go,” muttered Mdingi to
Kangata as they went to the cattlefold to do the milking.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Nomusa ran along the deeply marked path which
the cattle had made on their way from the kraal to the
pasture. She wasted no time, but still her keen eyes saw
signs that told what her brothers did in the pasture
all day.</p>

<p class='c003'>There were the remains of a fire. They must have
caught some birds and roasted them. And perhaps they
had taken some yams from their mothers’ vegetable
gardens. What a good time they must have had, thought
Nomusa.</p>

<p class='c003'>She could see large worn-out banana leaves on a
small clay slope. These the boys had used as sleds for
coasting. What fun it was, and how easy to find another
banana-leaf sled when the old one was worn out!</p>

<p class='c003'>Under a tree lay a large ball of leaves, twigs, and
moss. Nomusa knew what that had been used for. Her
brothers, lined up on two sides, had hurled pointed
sticks at the ball as it rolled swiftly downhill.</p>

<p class='c003'>Small wonder that Zulu boys grew up to be such
great hunters with their spears and bows and arrows.
Even little Themba had a toy bow and arrow with
which he played at hunting. But he used the chickens
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>and dogs around the kraal as targets, much to the annoyance
of his father’s wives.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa came upon some long sticks standing
against the trunk of a tree. She had often seen the boys
play this game in their kraal in the evening. Standing
opposite his opponent, each boy would try to strike
the other’s body, holding the stick in the middle so
that a large piece extended on each side of him. The
boys used all their speed and agility to try to ward off
the blows from their opponents’ sticks. A player had
to be skillful indeed or he would soon be covered
with bruises.</p>

<p class='c003'>As Nomusa had expected, the cow was nowhere
to be seen about the pasture. She began whistling loudly
and calling the cow with all her might.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Nyawuza! Nyawuza!”</p>

<p class='c003'>From a long way off came faintly the echo: “Nyawuza!
Nyawuza!”</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/i_050.jpg' alt='[Girl]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa decided she must go into the woods.
Where else could the cow have gone? Picking up a
pointed stick, Nomusa walked into the shadowy woods.</p>

<p class='c003'>She whistled Mdingi’s call over and over again.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>Moving between the well-spaced trees, she pushed
aside with her stick the vines and creepers that came
in her way. Once the whir of flying wings over her head
gave her a great fright.</p>

<p class='c003'>Only a bat! she thought, ashamed of her fear.</p>

<p class='c003'>But the farther she went into the woods the less
courageous she felt. She wished now that she had let
Mdingi come with her. Oh, where could Nyawuza have
gone? Was she perhaps already eaten by a lion or
a hyena?</p>

<p class='c003'>By this time Nomusa was deep in the woods. Her
eyes had become so accustomed to the darkness that
she was able to see where she was going quite well. She
called and whistled, she slapped at trees with her stick
to frighten off lurking animals. She had often heard that
the rhinoceros hated loud noises and ran away at sudden
sounds. She hoped it would frighten away other
animals, too.</p>

<p class='c003'>Once she saw some small glowing eyes peering at
her from a bush. It made Nomusa’s flesh creep with
dread. The fast beating of her heart made her whistle
tremble and quaver. Her throat suddenly went dry, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>she found herself scarcely able to utter any sound
whatever.</p>

<p class='c003'>All at once, Nomusa heard a low and doleful moo
from somewhere to the right of her. She plunged excitedly
through the thicket in the direction of the sound.
Another low, mournful moo.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa came to a small swamp; and there was
Nyawuza. One foot was caught in a liana, and she was
still struggling to free herself from the vine.</p>

<p class='c003'>With a cry of joy and relief, Nomusa rushed up
to the cow. She put her arms around her neck. “Nyawuza,
our dear one, are you hurt?”</p>

<p class='c003'>She bent down to examine Nyawuza’s leg and to
see how she could free her. Nyawuza had got herself
more and more entangled with the vine by trying to
free herself. First Nomusa pulled at it with all her
strength, but soon she saw that it required cutting. She
had no knife, so she tried using her pointed stick to get
between the vines and the cow’s leg. This hurt Nyawuza,
and she frantically pulled herself away.</p>

<p class='c003'>“What shall I do?” wondered Nomusa. She groped
about on the ground looking for a rock with a sharp
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>edge, feeling rather than seeing the stones. All at once
she felt a sharp pain in her hand.</p>

<p class='c003'>“A snake!” gasped Nomusa.</p>

<p class='c003'>But it was not a snake bite after all, but a cut made
by something sharp, perhaps the very thing she could
use to cut the vine. Nomusa bent down, feeling about
cautiously for the sharp object that had cut her.</p>

<p class='c003'>Ah! She had it—a stone with a knifelike edge,
half embedded in the earth. Nomusa dug it out, with
some difficulty, and ran to Nyawuza. She knelt in front
of the cow and held her leg firmly with one hand while
she chopped at the vine with the stone.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nyawuza looked on with melancholy eyes. The
task of cutting the liana was not easy, though the stone
was sharp. The vine was tough and full of sap, and it
did not break easily. But Nomusa worked and worked
at one place until she had cut it through. Finally
Nyawuza was free.</p>

<p class='c003'>By this time Nomusa was so tired that she felt as
if the kraal were a hundred miles away. “Come, good
Nyawuza. We must hurry home. Our mother is waiting.”</p>

<p class='c003'>On their dark journey homeward, Nomusa kept
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>up a conversation with the cow to reassure her. Now
and then Nomusa stumbled over rough ground and unexpected
bumps. Sometimes she was not at all sure
which was the right direction, and she grew frightened
at the thought of being lost.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_054.jpg' alt='[Girl]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c003'>It seemed a very long time before Nomusa felt
under her feet the familiar path leading to her kraal.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>Delighted to be so near home, she gave Nyawuza an
affectionate and resounding slap on her rump.</p>

<p class='c003'>The cow gave a sudden leap forward, and went
galloping into the kraal, almost dashing against a group
of Nomusa’s older brothers and sisters.</p>

<p class='c003'>But Nomusa did not stop to speak to them, for she
must find Mdingi at once. It was long past the cow’s
milking time, and her udder was swollen.</p>

<p class='c003'>Before Nomusa reached the cattlefold, Mdingi
came rushing to meet her. “You found her!” he cried
in relief. “I have been worried about you!” There was
much more that Mdingi wanted to say, but Nomusa
knew what he felt.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Go quickly,” she said gently. “Nyawuza needs
milking.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I go,” Mdingi said.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa turned back to the other children, who
were playing a spitting game. At a given signal, they
passed their hands before their mouths, spitting on the
palm as it passed. Then each child was given a chance
to guess where the spit had hit the hand.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa watched for a few moments, but she was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>too tired to play. As she was about to enter her hut,
she saw her father sitting outside the entrance gazing
at the rising moon and smoking his oxhorn pipe. Without
turning his head, he said quietly, “I am glad you
found the cow, my daughter.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Astonished, Nomusa said to herself, “By what
magic does my father always manage to know everything
that is happening in the kraal?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Before unrolling her mat, Nomusa took some half-cooked
pumpkin and some stewed meat from the pot.
Drowsily she began to eat. Puleng came to help her, and
together they finished the pumpkin and meat.</p>

<p class='c003'>With one arm around her dog’s neck, Nomusa
stretched out her tired legs and fell sound asleep.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>

</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'><span class='fss'>SIX</span>: Preparing for the Party</h2>
</div>

<p class='c002'>The first thing Nomusa thought when she
awoke was, “Today is the day of the party at Damasi’s
kraal! My work must be done quickly so I shall be ready
to go this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Mdingi and Kangata were now awake. Their eyes
shone with excitement, and Nomusa knew that they
too were thinking about the party. Because of it, they
would start off to the pasture earlier today.</p>

<p class='c003'>They helped themselves from the cook pot. Nomusa
pushed more dry twigs on the smoldering fire so her
mother could start cooking more food when the pot
was empty. She and her brothers made sure there was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>enough food left for their mother and Themba when
they awoke.</p>

<p class='c003'>Out of the hut crawled Nomusa, Mdingi, and
Kangata, one after the other, eating the food they held
in their hands. They looked up at the sky to see what
kind of day it was. Off in the distance Nomusa saw some
threatening-looking clouds.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, it’s not a nice day,” she said, disappointed.</p>

<p class='c003'>“That is true,” replied Mdingi; “but it may clear
up before we leave this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I think it’s going to rain,” said Kangata pessimistically.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Come along, Kangata,” ordered his big brother.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa was just leaving through the kraal gate
when she heard one of her sisters calling, “Nomusa, wait
for me!” It was Hlamba, the daughter of her father’s
third wife. Nomusa’s mother was his fourth wife.
Hlamba, too, was carrying a water jar, which she balanced
expertly on her grass-skirted hip.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa waited until Hlamba caught up with her.
“<i><span lang="zu">Sakubona!</span></i>” she greeted her. “I am glad to have your
company, sister. I see you are already wearing your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>new beads. They are beautiful! And is that the grass
skirt you are wearing to Damasi’s party?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, no,” said Hlamba loftily. “I am saving the
new one until we go. But I just couldn’t wait to wear
the beads.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Hlamba was taller and plumper than Nomusa.
Her body was beginning to take on the form of a woman,
and she felt her importance now that her age
required her to wear a grass skirt just like her mother’s.</p>

<p class='c003'>“When I am twelve years old, I suppose I shall
have to wear a grass skirt, too,” said Nomusa without
any enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Of course,” said Hlamba. “You will be a woman
then.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“A woman—in two years!” thought Nomusa.
Somehow she could not feel happy about it. She wanted
so much to play for a long, long time. She walked
beside Hlamba for a while, not saying a word, but
thinking a great deal. Hlamba kept a steady flow
of conversation most of the way, but Nomusa hardly
heard her. She kept talking about the designs she would
put on her body for the party.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>“And what designs and colors shall you paint on
your body?” Hlamba was asking. This question interested
Nomusa. All the way back to the kraal the
conversation continued about the preparations for
the party.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Do you know that our sister Sisiwe has tattooed
herself?” asked Nomusa.</p>

<p class='c003'>“So soon? Did she use a pointed stick, or did she
put the glowing embers on the cow dung over the skin?”
inquired Hlamba.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I saw her use a pointed stick. I hope the marks
will last at least until the day after the party,” said
Nomusa.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes, after all that work and pain of making the
tattoo,” said Hlamba sympathetically.</p>

<p class='c003'>When Nomusa and Hlamba brought their water
jars to their huts, the bigger boys were already in the
cattle pasture. Only the smaller children were playing
about in the kraal space. They were making toy kraals,
cattle, and dolls out of clay and baking them in the sun.</p>

<p class='c003'>There was Themba among the little boys, making
clay oxen and cattle kraals and pretending to trade toy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>cattle for dolls as wives. That was what the men did.</p>

<p class='c003'>While the small children played, the older girls
were busy helping their mothers, and there was great
activity inside and outside the huts.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa had finally finished weeding her mother’s
garden and had carried back in her left hand a large
pumpkin. In her right she held three long pieces of
sugar cane. Out of her mouth stuck a small piece of
sugar cane which she was chewing and sucking as she
walked briskly to her hut. She had stuck five gray and
white porcupine quills in her thick hair. Carefully she
dropped the pumpkin and the sugar cane before the
hut entrance and pushed them before her as she crawled
in.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, today you have returned very quickly,
Nomusa,” her mother said approvingly. “Have you
weeded the garden well?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“That I have, my mother,” said Nomusa. “And
see what I have brought you”—pointing proudly to the
quills in her hair.</p>

<p class='c003'>Her mother stopped brewing corn beer and came
over to examine the porcupine quills. She took one out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>of Nomusa’s hair and put it into her own, trying it out
by gently scratching her head with it.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yo! Very sharp point,” she observed. “How did
you get the quills?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“While I was weeding the garden, I saw the porcupine
close to the ground trying to creep out from
under our thorn fence. So I threw a large yam at it as
hard as I could, and although the porcupine got away,
the yam lay on the ground with these porcupine quills
in it.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_062.jpg' alt='[Girl]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>Her mother laughed aloud. “You are as good a shot
as your brothers. You would be a good hunter.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I would rather be a good hunter than be allowed
to wear a grass skirt,” confessed Nomusa.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Perhaps you can do both; but you will learn that
it is good to be a woman, too. How are the crops? Are
any pineapples ripe yet?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“No, my mother. They are still hard and green. I
felt all of them. But the beans will be ready by tomorrow,
I am sure. I go now to gather wood for your fire.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Very well, Nomusa. Hurry with your chores so
you can prepare yourself for the party.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa smiled at her mother, grateful to her for
understanding what was in her mind.</p>

<p class='c003'>When she had returned with the firewood and
ground some corn, her mother said, “You have done
enough. The sun is now high, and it is time for you to
paint and grease yourself.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa did not have to be urged twice. She took
out her little piles of ground stone, which were lying
neatly on large leaves, carried them carefully outdoors,
and laid them on the shady side of the hut while she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>got some water and lamb fat. Leaving each color on its
separate leaf, Nomusa poured water, drop by drop, first
on the red powder, then on the black, then on the white,
mixing each with a different thin twig. Into each color
she stirred a little fat until it was just the right thickness.
As if she were a chemist, she examined each color
with the tip of her finger to see that it was neither too
thin nor too thick, neither too light nor too dark. From
time to time she tried a little of the color on her arm
in order to see if it was just the right shade and would
stay on well.</p>

<p class='c003'>Finally Nomusa was satisfied. With some soft dried
rabbits’ paws that she used as paintbrushes, she began
smearing her body, first putting on the red coat that
made her skin a lovely warm copper color. She waited
a few minutes for it to dry well. On top of the red paint
she began putting the designs she had decided on long
ago. The white circles were painted on first, then black
circles put around these. Radiating from these she drew
shapes of diamonds, squares, a series of wavy lines, and
then dots. It was such a balanced pattern of design and
color that an artist could not have done better. For her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>back she needed some help; so she called Sisiwe, who
was coming out of her hut.</p>

<p class='c003'>“What, you are all ready?” asked Sisiwe. “Why, I
haven’t even finished my work yet. I still have to get
wood and grind some corn. It’s a good thing the tattooing
is done.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I will help you with the corn, Sisiwe, if you paint
my back the way I tell you to.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I shall do it gladly, Nomusa.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Carefully, Nomusa stooped before Sisiwe’s grinding
stone, afraid lest she make cracks in the paint on
her body. She began grinding the corn, throwing into
the scooped stone a handful of dried kernels now and
then. Sisiwe, more cheerful now, ran quickly out of the
kraal for the wood.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/i_065.jpg' alt='[Girl]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c003'>While Nomusa worked, she could not help admiring
herself, and her eyes wandered up and down the
front of her body. Nomusa was pleased with her designs.
When she had given her body a final layer of grease to
protect and bring out the colors of the paint and had
put on all her bangles and bracelets, she would look
beautiful indeed. She would not forget to wear her new
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>oxhide neck-pocket, either. Already she had put into it
most of her best treasures, to be exchanged for even
better ones, she hoped, with Damasi’s guests.</p>

<p class='c003'>It did not seem at all long before Sisiwe was back
again, her arms filled with branches and twigs. She
dropped her load behind her hut, then carried into the
hut as much wood as her mother would need for several
hours. Out she ran to Nomusa and squatted beside her,
taking the grinding stone out of her hand.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I can go on grinding if you will get my paints and
cover my back with red paint,” said Nomusa.</p>

<p class='c003'>Sisiwe darted over to Nomusa’s hut to gather up
the paints. When she returned, Nomusa said, “I think
the paints will need more water. They are a little dry
now. When you have used what you need on my back,
you may have the rest of the colors for yourself.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“You are good, Nomusa.” Sisiwe added some water
to the paint, stirring water and paint together with great
care. She began covering Nomusa’s back with the red
color as smoothly as she could. Nomusa giggled as the
rabbit’s foot tickled her sides.</p>

<p class='c003'>After having made the designs and used the colors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>Nomusa showed her, Sisiwe said, “It is done now, and
you look splendid.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I can help you with your back, just as you did
mine,” said Nomusa. With Nomusa’s help it did not
take long for Sisiwe to be completely painted. Nomusa
then went back to her hut to get her bangles and beads.
She reappeared before Sisiwe wearing them around her
waist, her neck, her elbows, her upper arms, her ankles,
the calves of her legs, and her knees. She was now well
greased, too, and glistened in the sun. Her bulging oxhide
neck-pocket, soft and new, hung around her neck.
A thin circlet of white, green, and red beads surrounded
her pretty head.</p>

<p class='c003'>As her little brothers and sisters saw Nomusa
approach they stopped everything they were doing. Excitedly
they crowded around to examine her decorations
and adornments and point out to one another the extraordinary
designs on her body. They touched her shiny
bangles, her beads and bracelets, all of which she had
made herself.</p>

<p class='c003'>“How I wish I could go to Damasi’s party, too,”
said one of her small admirers. “Did you make this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>bracelet?” asked another. “Where did you get those
beads?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Puleng returned from some little adventure he had
been having and began to bark at Nomusa, disturbed
over her strange appearance. What with his barking
and the shouting and loud questions of all the children
crowding round Nomusa and Sisiwe, there was such a
din that mothers stuck their heads out of the entrance
of their huts and crossly commanded, “<i><span lang="zu">Tula!</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Hush!” warned Nomusa. “You will wake all the
babies.” She stroked Puleng’s head to reassure him and
quiet his barking.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Here come the others, ready for the party,” announced
Sisiwe. “Oh, look!”</p>

<p class='c003'>Nineteen boys and girls—painted, greased, bedecked
with all kinds of beads and bangles encircling
almost every part of the body—began gathering at the
kraal entrance ready to set forth. Some of the girls wore
grass skirts; some of the boys were wearing antelope
belts for the first time and were proudly fingering and
arranging them. Some had feathers stuck in their hair.
Faces were painted with designs meant to terrify and
amuse.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_068.jpg' alt='[Children]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Nomusa and Sisiwe joined their older sisters and
brothers at the kraal entrance. They were ready to start
for the party now. The smaller children, who were being
left behind, began jumping and shouting around them,
cheering as they left.</p>

<p class='c003'>The morning haze had disappeared, and Damasi’s
kraal could now be seen clearly on the hill beyond. As
Nomusa walked along with her nineteen excited brothers
and sisters, she fingered her neck-pocket and began
to think of Damasi and how glad she would be to see him.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>
<img src='images/i_071.jpg' alt='[Huts]' class='ig001'>
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'><span class='fss'>SEVEN</span>: Damasi’s Party</h2>
</div>

<p class='c002'>The distance to Damasi’s kraal was quite
far, but it did not seem so to Nomusa or to her brothers
and sisters as they walked toward it, single file. Far off,
they saw a thin line of children coming in their direction.
They, too, were on their way to the party. Nomusa
wondered how many children would be at Damasi’s
party. Maybe a hundred.</p>

<p class='c003'>Kangata was terribly excited about going to a
party in a neighboring kraal. It was his first one.</p>

<p class='c003'>“We are near now, Nomusa, are we not?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes,” she answered. She began to laugh as she
looked at her small brother’s face, for it was marked and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>painted in such a curious and grotesque manner that
his nose looked as if it had been divided in two.</p>

<p class='c003'>Kangata looked offended and put his grubby hand
up to his face to discover the cause of Nomusa’s mirth.
Nomusa quickly reassured him. “You have certainly
made a design like that of no other. Perhaps you will
win a prize.”</p>

<p class='c003'>When the children neared the thorn fence surrounding
Damasi’s kraal, Zabala walked forward
quickly to lead the line of twenty brothers and sisters,
all children of Nomusa’s father. Zabala, whose mother
was called Great Wife because she was Zitu’s first wife,
would be chief of Nomusa’s kraal some day, because
he was Zitu’s eldest son.</p>

<p class='c003'>Standing just within the entrance of the kraal to
greet the guests as they entered were Damasi’s father
and uncle and their wives. They pointed out the huts
that had been reserved for the party.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa found Kangata close at her side, his eyes
wide with curiosity, trying to see everything in the
strange kraal at once. Delicious smells of food cooking
filled the air and made Kangata’s mouth water.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>Nomusa began straightening the halo of beads
around her head, adjusting some of the bangles that
had got twisted on the way. Most of her sisters were
arranging their short grass skirts and bead kilts, too.</p>

<p class='c003'>Zabala walked up to the entrance of Damasi’s hut,
followed by his nineteen brothers and sisters. He stood
tall before the hut, legs apart, arms by his side, and
loudly cleared his throat. “A-hem!” But there was so
much noise in the hut, and such excitement, that no
one, it seemed, had heard his announcement of their
arrival. Again he cleared his throat, this time more
loudly, with a reinforcement of “A-hems” from behind
him. Zabala glowered at those who had given him this
unwanted help.</p>

<p class='c003'>This time they were heard. There was a sudden
hush within. Almost immediately a fantastic-looking
head, stuck full of small birds’ feathers, green, blue,
yellow, and red, appeared in the entrance. It was
Damasi. “<i><span lang="zu">Sakubona! Sakubona!</span></i>” he said, smiling.</p>

<p class='c003'>“<i><span lang="zu">Usaphila! Usaphila!</span></i>” called the guests from
Nomusa’s kraal.</p>

<p class='c003'>Chief for the day, Damasi was in charge of everything.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>He quickly beckoned to everyone to enter. First
went Zabala. Then, one by one, all the brothers and
sisters crawled in after him on hands and knees.</p>

<p class='c003'>At first the children from Nomusa’s kraal were shy,
but soon they began to mingle freely with the other
guests. Waves of noise surged up in the hut. More guests
arrived, making the hut hotter and noisier than ever.
The boys wandered over to one side of the hut, and the
girls stayed at the other.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa went to look at a calf that was tied in a
corner of the hut. It was only a few days old and still
too young to be taken to pasture. Together with a
young goat, it was being kept as a pet. Girls did not
often have a chance to be with cows and calves, and
Nomusa enjoyed petting the calf.</p>

<p class='c003'>Several dogs which had followed some of the children
to the party ran in and out, between and over the
legs of the smaller guests, looking for pieces of food that
had been dropped on the floor. Every little while there
was a fight between two dogs when both snatched at the
same morsel.</p>

<p class='c003'>Their barking, snapping, and growling frightened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>the chickens that had wandered in. Flapping their
wings in terror, they crowed and cackled, one or two
flying onto the backs of the shrieking children.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_075.jpg' alt='[Family]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c003'>This caused more excitement, laughter, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>screeching, until the poor little calf began to strain at its
grass rope in an effort to get away. Nomusa patted her.
“Do not be afraid, little calf. I will not let anyone
hurt you.”</p>

<p class='c003'>While she was talking to the calf, Damasi’s sister
Intombi, a year older than Nomusa, came up to her
and said, “It is a fine calf. Do you like it?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Who would not?” answered Nomusa. “She will
be a beautiful cow.” Then, seeing Intombi’s bulging
neck-pocket, she pointed to it. “What have you in
there?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I will gladly show you,” said Intombi. “But you
must show me what is in your pocket, too.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa opened her neck-pocket and drew from it
a red and green feather, now somewhat bent—the one
she had found at the stream.</p>

<p class='c003'>“M-m-m-m!” said Intombi, admiringly. “What
else have you?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa’s fingers probed the depths of her pocket.
She brought out a lovely bead of clay, brown, with a
red and yellow border. The bead was no bigger than
a small grape. “I made it myself,” explained Nomusa.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>“I found a very special kind of clay, mixed the colors,
and then baked it in the sun. Do you like it?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I do,” said Intombi. “If you will part with it, I will
give you this.” She quickly loosened her bulging neck-pocket
and took out something brown, spotted with
white. It looked very soft and furry.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why, it’s a deer mouse!” cried Nomusa. “Where
did you get it?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I found it nibbling in my mother’s garden. If you
like it, you may have it in exchange for the bead.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Be careful not to drop the bead, for it may break,”
Nomusa said, handing it to Intombi and taking the
deer mouse.</p>

<p class='c003'>“It’s not alive, you know,” Intombi said, as she saw
Nomusa carefully examining her new treasure.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Is it still good to eat?” Nomusa asked.</p>

<p class='c003'>“That I do not know, but the fur can be used.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Intombi opened her neck-pocket wide and showed
Nomusa all the bits of stone, feathers, bangles, and
other trinkets that she carried around with her. Suddenly
Intombi sprang up. “Oh, they are starting
another game. Let us play, too, Nomusa.”</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>“What are they playing?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Husbands and wives. It’s lots of fun. I hope
Zabala chooses me.” Intombi moved closer to the line
of boys so that Zabala would not fail to see her. She
looked smilingly at him until he caught her eye.</p>

<p class='c003'>How tiresome to play such a game, thought
Nomusa. I should much prefer going outside.</p>

<p class='c003'>She was standing apart, watching the good-natured
scramble of the boys picking their girls, not
once thinking about a partner for herself. Suddenly she
felt someone tapping her shoulder insistently. “You
are my wife for this game,” Damasi said. “Now let me
see if you are a good one.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“And let me see if you are a good husband,”
replied Nomusa.</p>

<p class='c003'>The girls picked up little grass mats and baskets
and filled them with food for themselves and their “husbands.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Damasi said to Nomusa, “I hear you can do all the
things that a boy can do. Are you a good cook, too?
That is more important.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“You shall see,” answered Nomusa. “But you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>must promise to go outside with me afterwards to shoot
at targets.” She set to work to prepare a dish that would
not take very long. Soon she gave Damasi a mixture
of chicken, corn, pumpkin, goat meat, and fried locust.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Very good,” said Damasi. “Now pass me the
<i><span lang="zu">amasi</span></i>.” These were the delicious curds of clotted milk
that Nomusa liked so much. They were excellent for
cooling and for quenching one’s thirst. When Damasi
had finished, he belched and said, “Soon we’ll see if you
are as good a hunter as you are a cook.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Let us go outside now,” Nomusa suggested, “if
you have finished eating.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Together they left the hut. Damasi went into one
of the other huts and brought out two bows and some
arrows. One bow he handed to Nomusa.</p>

<p class='c003'>“See if you can hit that branch,” he said, pointing.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa stood straight and drew her right arm
back with a quick pull. Off sped the arrow, straight
into the middle of the thick branch.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Good!” shouted Damasi. “We’ll each take five
turns and see how many hits we make.”</p>

<p class='c003'>As Damasi took a shot, Nomusa saw a bird flying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>about a hundred yards away. Quickly she let the arrow
go, and down went the bird.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Not many boys your age can shoot a bird on the
wing,” said Damasi admiringly. “Where did you practice
shooting?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“In my mother’s garden,” answered Nomusa.</p>

<p class='c003'>Just then Mdingi appeared. “Let me shoot,” he said.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Let us take turns shooting,” said Nomusa. “You
first, Damasi. Then Mdingi, then I.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Damasi let his arrows fly swiftly, one after the
other. “Three out of five,” announced Nomusa, running
to pick up the fallen arrows.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Your turn, Mdingi,” said Damasi.</p>

<p class='c003'>Taking careful aim, Mdingi shot his five arrows.
“Four out of five!” he shouted.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa aimed and shot. “Three out of five, like
me, Nomusa,” Damasi said.</p>

<p class='c003'>By now the younger children had grown tired of
being husbands and wives—especially the girls, since
they had to do all the work for the boys. The smaller
girls began to play with clay dolls, and the little boys
ran outdoors to play horse.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>Sisiwe came up to Nomusa. “What will everyone
think of you, playing with boys, shooting at a mark,”
she scolded. “You make us ridiculous with your tomboy
ways! What good will it do you to know how to trap
and shoot? You will never be allowed to go on a hunt.
It is better for you to know how to be a good wife.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa left Damasi and went to sit with the girls
from neighboring kraals. Bored, she listened to stories
about things that had been going on in their kraals since
the last time they had seen each other: about new
babies, accidents to brothers or sisters, what vegetables
were growing in their mothers’ gardens, and such
things. Body designs were compared and discussed,
grass skirts felt, beads admired, and new teeth examined.</p>

<p class='c003'>There was no special hour for eating. Children
wandered in and out of the hut to get what they wanted.
It was a never-ending feast.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>

</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'><span class='fss'>EIGHT</span>: Runaway Prize</h2>
</div>

<p class='c002'>Nomusa went into the warm hut for some
pumpkin, but she came out quickly. She drew in a long
breath of fresh air and wiped her perspiring brow.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, how good the night air feels!” she said to
Intombi. “The moon is high, and the stars are sparkling
already.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The cry of a very young baby was heard. Nomusa
looked at Intombi.</p>

<p class='c003'>“My uncle’s wife has a new baby, born eight days
ago. Should you like to see her?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa was glad to accept the invitation. She
loved babies, and she was glad to get away from the
gossiping girls.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>Together they walked over to the hut. In front of
the entrance, Intombi turned to Nomusa. “Here are
the ashes of the magic herb in which you must rub your
feet before entering. You have come a long way, and
you may have got something evil on them. With new
babies we have to be very careful, you know.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa obediently rubbed her feet in the ashes
while Intombi gave a polite cough, which was answered
from within by a quiet, friendly “<i><span lang="zu">Bayete</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa and Intombi entered the hut. Nomusa
smiled as she caught sight of the new baby, who was
still moist from her bath.</p>

<p class='c003'>“It is Nomusa,” said Intombi simply to the baby’s
mother.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa’s delight in the baby was plain to see; in
a few moments she took off one of her necklaces of small
shells and hung it around the baby’s plump neck.</p>

<p class='c003'>“It is a present for the baby,” Nomusa said to the
mother. “She is strong and big for her age. I hope she
will grow up to be clever in boys’ work as well as in
girls’.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“We had not chosen a name for her,” said the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>mother, surprised at Nomusa’s wish, “but now I know
what it will be. We shall call her Nomusa, which means
kindness, for you.”</p>

<p class='c003'>At these words Nomusa blushed so that her face
had an even more beautiful color. It was the first time
such an honor had been done her, and she was pleased
and proud.</p>

<p class='c003'>Soon after, Nomusa and Intombi left to join the
other children. They found them all assembled in a
huge circle in the kraal space. Damasi was in the center
going from one child to another examining body designs.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Hurry, get into the circle, or it will be too late,”
shouted Kangata impatiently when he saw Nomusa
coming along.</p>

<p class='c003'>She and Intombi lost no time in squeezing in next
to some of the bigger girls, adding their laughter and
chatter to that of the others as they waited for Damasi
to finish judging the designs.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Among the boys,” announced Damasi finally,
“the prize goes to Fanase. Among the girls”—and he
hesitated for the moment as if making up his mind—“the
prize goes to Nomusa.”</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>Unbelieving, Nomusa looked at Intombi and then
turned her head in the direction of Kangata. His face
was full of disappointment and misery. Sad for her
little brother, Nomusa could take no pleasure in having
been awarded a prize. Just as she was thinking, “I shall
give Kangata my prize,” she heard Damasi shouting
out loudly, “The prize for the funniest design goes
to Kangata!”</p>

<p class='c003'>There was a roar of laughter. The children clicked
their tongues, “<em>tsick tsick</em>,” in congratulation. For a few
moments Kangata did not know whether to laugh or
to cry, but when Damasi called him into the large ring
of children and handed him a basket full of roasted
winged ants, locusts, and caterpillars, his face broke
into a cheerful grin, and he began to laugh, too. This
caused the other children to laugh still more, and soon
the kraal echoed with their pleasure. Nomusa expected
to hear some of the mothers shout “<i><span lang="zu">Tula!</span></i>” from their
huts, but no one did. It was Damasi’s party, and the
children could do as they pleased for this one day.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Come into the ring, Nomusa,” called Damasi,
“so everyone can see your designs.” More emphatic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>“<em>tsick tsicks</em>” clicked around her. A little embarrassed,
she took Kangata’s hand and then looked down toward
her wriggling toes.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I wonder what you’re going to get,” whispered
Kangata. But Nomusa neither answered nor looked up.
Her only desire was to be allowed to get out of the
middle of the ring and go back to Intombi’s side at
once. What took Damasi so long? This was a poor
joke—leaving her there next to Kangata with all those
children staring at her. Kangata, however, was unconcerned.
He was eating a locust with great relish and
trying at the same time to count the number of delicacies
he had won.</p>

<p class='c003'>All at once the children grew silent. Nomusa
looked up to see Damasi coming toward her with a very
small gray striped monkey clinging to his neck with
both little hands. When she saw the monkey, Nomusa’s
heart began to beat faster.</p>

<p class='c003'>“For you,” she heard Damasi saying, as he gently
unclasped the monkey’s arms from around his neck and
handed him to Nomusa.</p>

<p class='c003'>She murmured her thanks and tenderly took the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>little animal in her arms. She could hardly believe she
had won such a marvelous prize.</p>

<p class='c003'>The girls crowded around Nomusa, trying to pet
the little monkey. But he clung to Nomusa.</p>

<p class='c003'>“See, he loves you already,” said Intombi. “What
are you going to call him?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“He is striped like a zebra,” Nomusa said, still in
a sort of daze. “I think I shall call him Dube.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I am happy because you like your prize,” said
Damasi in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, thank you, Damasi! Indeed I like him very
much! It is the best present I have ever had.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The sun had set long ago. Whatever the mellow
light of the moon did not reach was bathed in darkness.
As Nomusa stood holding Dube and petting him,
Sisiwe came to her.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Look, Nomusa. They are bringing out the drums.
That means we shall soon begin to dance.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, I had better go right away and tie Dube in
one of the huts so he won’t run away.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa carried Dube into one of the empty party
huts. He did not like it when Nomusa put him in a corner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>and tied a cord around his neck. The sound of
drums from outside frightened Dube. He clung to
Nomusa’s leg as if begging her not to leave him. The
drums sounded again.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, the dance!” cried Nomusa. Torn between
her desire to stay with Dube and her eagerness to go
to the dance, she pleaded. “Oh, Dube, I really can’t
stay any longer!”</p>

<p class='c003'>Dropping the monkey on the floor, she rushed out
to join the dancers. She fell in with one of the rows of
children who were already hopping along rhythmically
on one leg and chanting “<i><span lang="zu">khelekhelekobe ngajlatshwa
ameva</span></i>” to the beat of a pot drum.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_088.jpg' alt='[Girl]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>It was nothing but a large earthenware pot with
a goatskin drawn tightly over the mouth of it. Damasi’s
cousin, Bongoza, was playing it by tapping it with the
palm and fingers of his hand. The excited and varied
rhythms he produced threw the dancers into a joyful
frenzy; they hopped first on one leg, then on the other,
shouting and chanting.</p>

<p class='c003'>After this dance had stopped, Damasi appeared
with a bow made of a bent reed which he had strung
tight with an ox-tendon string. He held one end of the
bow in his lips and twanged the string with his thumb.
This was the signal for another dance, and the children
sprang up again.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/i_089.jpg' alt='[Guitar]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The dancers got in a long line, and this time they
composed their own dance. They turned to each other,
grunting and screwing up their faces. Such hideous
grimaces as they made! It was terrifying enough to
scare away a lion, Nomusa thought. Soon she decided
it was more fun to drop out of the dance and watch it.
She singled out Kangata, whose movements and dreadful
faces were so comical that Nomusa’s sides ached
from laughing.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>“Oh, that Kangata!” she exclaimed. “What awful
faces!”</p>

<p class='c003'>Intombi had dropped out, too. “Let us get some
corn kernels so we can play the game of guessing bird
names,” she suggested.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa went with her to a pile of dried mealie
cobs. They began stripping off kernels and dropping
them into a basket. When they had enough, the girls
carried the basket out to an open space. Together they
laid the kernels in rows on the ground.</p>

<p class='c003'>From all sides came the children, eager to take part
in the new game. “<em>Bula Msense!</em>” they called to each
other, announcing the game.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Boys on one side, girls on the other,” cried Intombi.</p>

<p class='c003'>The smaller children did not take part in this
game; so they stood to one side watching the others.
Each child was given a turn at naming a bird for each
kernel, picking up a kernel if he could offer a name no
other child had yet given. If he could not name a different
bird, he had to drop out of the game.</p>

<p class='c003'>At the beginning the corn kernels disappeared
quickly as a child from one side would call out “finch,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>and the other side would cry “honey-bird,” or “white-eye,”
or “woodpecker,” or “nightjar.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa marveled at the number of birds the children
knew. She was ashamed of having been eliminated
when the game was not yet half over. Mdingi was still
going strong against Damasi, Zabala, and Bongoza.
Nomusa was very proud of him. Excitedly the onlookers
cheered on the remaining contestants.</p>

<p class='c003'>Presently it was announced that Mdingi was the
winner. Intombi brought him a narrow belt of oxhide,
with beads dangling from it; and everyone cheered as
Mdingi delightedly fastened it around his slim waist.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was now the turn of the smaller children to have
a dance or game of their own. Kangata boldly walked
into the empty space and began showing a new dance
he had invented. As he chanted, he jumped up, at the
same time kicking his buttocks with his bare heels. The
other children imitated him.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was a strenuous dance, and as the children grew
tired, their throats became parched and they uttered
their songs in short gasps. Weak corn beer and <i><span lang="zu">amasi</span></i>
were passed around to quench their thirst.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>One of the older boys now came up, playing a flute
made of the chinbone of a reedbuck. He sat on the
ground and made up plaintive tunes while the children
gathered around him, munching kaffir plums, blackberries,
wild figs, or roasted caterpillars. The soothing
music of the flute calmed the children and made the
little ones so sleepy that they dozed off and had to be
carried into the huts and laid on mats to sleep.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was now midnight, and the moon floated behind
some wispy clouds, making them luminous and gray.
The older boys left the kraal and went off by themselves.
Nomusa decided that instead of joining a girl’s
game she would go to the hut where she had left Dube.</p>

<p class='c003'>Softly she groped her way among sleeping children
to Dube’s corner, expecting him to jump into her
arms. But he did not come to her. He must be asleep,
Nomusa thought. She was glad, for it made her feel
less selfish for having left him.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was quite dark in the corner, so she began feeling
for Dube. At last she found the cord. But there was
no monkey attached to it. With a sudden pang Nomusa
realized that Dube might have run away.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>Quietly, so as not to waken the sleeping children,
she moved about the hut, hoping to find Dube hiding.
But he was not there. Nomusa left the hut, wondering
what to do. She decided to search in all the huts, and
began by entering the main one, where the girls were
busy playing <i><span lang="zu">ngelitshe</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yo, Nomusa!” they called. “Have you been in
the hills with the boys, or have you been asleep in one
of the huts with the little ones?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa smiled wretchedly, and Intombi said,
“Come and play with us, Nomusa. You will beat us all
at this stone game. Here, take my stones for a while.
I am tired.” Nomusa wanted to say that she was weary
of all these boring girls’ games, but instead she squatted
beside Intombi, taking the five stones.</p>

<p class='c003'>Her heart was heavy as she held the stones in her
hand. The game was to hold all the stones in one hand,
tossing one into the air while holding all the others and
catching the stone in the same hand. Each time a different
stone was thrown. When a player failed to catch
a stone, she was eliminated from the game. It was easy
for Nomusa. She did not feel like playing, and as soon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>as the attention of the girls was turned from her, her
eyes roamed over every part of the hut, searching for
Dube. In an absent-minded way she tossed her stones,
turning her head from side to side and then back, just
in time to catch the tossed stone in her hand again.</p>

<p class='c003'>After a while Nomusa decided to leave the hut.
She gave the stones back to Intombi and crept out into
the cool air of the starlit night. The girls continued
with their game, forgetting about Nomusa.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'><span class='fss'>NINE</span>: Wild Boar</h2>
</div>

<p class='c002'>Outdoors it was dark and still. Who could
find a monkey now? From somewhere far off Nomusa
could hear the shouts of the older boys. In the waning
moonlight she began walking toward the huts in which
she had not made a search. How thankful she was
that there were still places to search.</p>

<p class='c003'>Walking toward the hut nearest the kraal entrance,
she was suddenly startled by a long black shadow that
seemed to withdraw hastily as she approached. Nomusa
stood still, frightened but curious. Something was prowling
outside the kraal fence. There was no doubt of that.</p>

<p class='c003'>Again the shadow passed the kraal entrance, as
if deciding whether it should come in or not. Nomusa
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>felt goose flesh creep over her whole body. Was it a
wild animal about to attack them? What should she do?
She had no weapon with which to drive it off or kill it.
She wanted to run or shout for help. The children might
be in great danger if she did not act quickly. But if she
screamed to attract the attention of Damasi’s father
and uncle, she might cause whatever it was to rush in
at once and attack.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_096.jpg' alt='[Girl]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>Again she saw the indistinct form. At the same
time, as the moon reappeared from under the clouds,
Nomusa’s eye caught the glint of something long and
pointed lying next to one of the huts. Could it be a
spear? What a lucky thing if it was a weapon of some
kind! When the shadow disappeared again and the
moon floated under the clouds once more, Nomusa
dashed to the object she hoped was a spear. Yo! It was.
She picked it up just as if she had been accustomed to
holding such weapons all her life. Nomusa did not
doubt for a moment that she would know how to handle
it. Often enough she had watched the men and boys
throwing spears. Secretly she had even practiced with
long, heavy sticks.</p>

<p class='c003'>She felt the point of the spear with her finger. It
was very sharp. She began moving cautiously. Nomusa’s
hair fairly stood on end as she saw that the black thing
was a wild boar. Only too well she knew how fierce
a wild boar could be. Every Zulu feared and hated this
vicious beast with his dangerous tusks. Standing with
her back flattened against the kraal fence, close to the
entrance, with spear up and ready, Nomusa hid in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>deep shadow. She waited tensely for the boar to venture
in. The wind, fortunately, was blowing in such a
direction that the boar couldn’t get her scent. Her upraised
arm trembled a bit, then became steady as
she waited.</p>

<p class='c003'>Soon the boar’s ugly head appeared within the
kraal entrance not far from Nomusa. He had decided to
come in. It was a rare chance for him. Ordinarily the
kraal fence was entirely closed, but tonight, because the
older boys were out, the kraal gate was left open for
them. Slowly the beast moved his clumsy body through
the kraal entrance. Once within, he lowered his head
as if he had got a whiff of something and, with a snort,
got ready to rush in the direction of the hut where the
girls were playing <i><span lang="zu">ngelitshe</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c003'>There was no time to lose. With all her might,
Nomusa hurled her spear at the neck of the boar. <em>Hau!</em>
The spear caught him in the throat. With an enraged
snort, he rushed toward Nomusa, the spear still sticking
in his neck. He stumbled, and got up again. His
roars, mingled with grunts of pain, woke up Damasi’s
father and uncle, as well as everyone else who had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>asleep. Intombi and Sisiwe rushed out of the hut, followed
by the other girls. When they saw the wounded
boar they ran behind the hut.</p>

<p class='c003'>The boar had now fallen, close to one of the huts.
He made powerful efforts to raise himself and almost
got up, when Damasi’s father dashed up. He let fly an
arrow from his bow, and the boar fell dead.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa ran to the side of Damasi’s father. “How
glad I am you came!”</p>

<p class='c003'>Amazed, he asked, “Was it you who hurled the
spear?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa nodded.</p>

<p class='c003'>Everyone crowded round the dead boar in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c003'>Damasi’s father said: “Nomusa is a brave girl. It
was she who discovered the boar and wounded him.
She has saved us from great danger. I shall tell her
father, Chief Zitu, about her bravery.”</p>

<p class='c003'>There were loud cries of agreement. “Hau! Yo!”</p>

<p class='c003'>Damasi’s father put his arm around Nomusa’s
shoulder. “Come and rest. You are weary.”</p>

<p class='c003'>She followed him obediently. Unrolling a mat in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>little hut occupied by Damasi’s mother and his baby
brother, she threw herself upon it, exhausted. Only now
did Nomusa realize fully the great danger she had been
in and how lucky she had been. Oh, how tired and
sleepy she was! Yawning, she put her arm under her
head as a pillow and was about to fall asleep when there
flashed through her mind the memory of her lost monkey,
whom she had forgotten in all the excitement.</p>

<p class='c003'>Her eyes filled with tears and she tried to swallow
the lump in her throat. She buried her head in her arms.
The joy of the day was entirely gone. Though she had
been a brave hunter but a short time before, now she
was only a small girl crying bitterly over a lost pet.</p>

<p class='c003'>At last she dozed off and fell to dreaming of her
search through deep and dangerous forests for her
little monkey.</p>

<p class='c003'>Muttering restlessly, Nomusa tossed from side to
side in her sleep. She put her hand on her neck to
scratch herself. Suddenly she felt something soft and
warm moving across her shoulders and the back of her
neck. She woke up with a start and clutched at the thing
with both hands. There was a squeal of pain as she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>pulled it forward. Her fright turned to joy as she saw
that what she held in her hand was the tail of a monkey.
Dube!</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, I have hurt you!” cried Nomusa, taking
Dube in her arms and hugging him.</p>

<p class='c003'>Damasi’s mother smiled and said, “I am glad you
like the little monkey. Damasi went to a great deal of
trouble to get him when he was tending the cows in
the pasture. He kept him as a pet for himself until you
won him as a prize.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Just then Damasi’s baby brother wailed. “<i><span lang="zu">Tula!</span></i> We
must be quiet now,” warned Damasi’s mother, and
then, lying down on the mat next to the baby, she
began nursing him. Soon he fell asleep again. Nomusa
lay down on her mat, too, drawing Dube close to her.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Where did you go to, you bad little Dube?” she
whispered to him affectionately.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Tchirk? Tchirk?” Dube answered, snuggling beside
her. The warmth of his body next to her shoulder
soothed Nomusa into a sleep from which she did not
waken until she heard loud calls of “Come! Come!
Time to go back to our kraals. Hurry, we are going!”</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>The sun was just rising above the horizon. The
sky was lined with rose and deep blue, but the early
morning air was cool, and the waiting children jumped
about to keep warm. Pink and red flowers dotted the
fields a short distance away, and a few birds were beginning
to twitter.</p>

<p class='c003'>The older boys straggled back into their groups
exhausted and irritable because they had not slept
all night. But they were aroused into curiosity by cries
of “Did you hear? Don’t you know?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“What? What? Tell us,” they demanded eagerly.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Nomusa and her wild boar. She hit it with a
spear. You can see it over there—behind the cattle
kraal.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Those who had not yet seen the dead boar ran
off at once, to return full of astonishment. They all
agreed Nomusa was as good as any boy. Sisiwe had to
admit that it was lucky for all of them that Nomusa
liked shooting and hunting.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa was surrounded by the girls in her group,
who gazed upon her with pride and envy. What a lot
she would have to tell Themba! She could hardly wait
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>to see his face when she showed him the monkey. She
knew he would ask her to tell him the story of the boar
over and over again.</p>

<p class='c003'>There was a loud whistle. The children fell into
lines, waving good-by to Damasi and his brothers and
sisters and cousins. Tired and bedraggled, the children
marched off. Some pushed each other ill-humoredly
and quarreled on the way home, but finally they reached
their kraals in time to begin their various duties—the
boys going off to the pasture, the girls to their tasks.
The boys hoped to make up their lack of sleep while
tending the cows; but the girls knew they would have
to wait until evening before they slept again. As soon
as Nomusa entered her kraal with her brothers and
sisters, she went directly to her hut to start her work.</p>

<p class='c003'>In a few moments Nomusa was out of the hut
again, headed for the stream with Dube perched on the
empty water jar that rested on her hip. She fairly
danced along the path as she looked at Dube and
thought, “Never will my trips for water be tiresome
again.” She tweaked his ear gently, and Dube looked
up at her and said, “Tchirk, tchirk.”</p>

  <h2 class='c009'><span class='fss'>TEN</span>: Zitu’s Messenger</h2>
</div>

<p class='c002'>For most of the children, the days that
followed the party seemed like all other days. But not
for Nomusa. She had Dube.</p>

<p class='c003'>Sometimes she took him with her when she went
to the stream. But often she left him behind with
Themba, who loved the little monkey almost as much
as Nomusa did.</p>

<p class='c003'>One morning Nomusa was sitting with Themba
and Dube outside their hut, telling her little brother
the story of Damasi’s party and the wild boar. Already
she had told it to him dozens of times, but Themba still
loved to hear it.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Nomusa!” called Makanya.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Nomusa crawled inside the hut. Her mother
was feeding Bala.</p>

<p class='c003'>“When you weed the garden today, I want you
to see what vegetables and fruits will be ready to pick
in the morning,” said Makanya. “Tomorrow is the day
for your father’s visit. He may not be coming again for
some time, and I want him to remember this visit.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Is my father going on the elephant hunt soon?”
Nomusa asked.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes, but I do not know when. He will send a messenger
to the headmen of the neighboring kraals.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“How I wish I could go with him!” Nomusa said.</p>

<p class='c003'>“This is foolish, Nomusa,” her mother said, almost
sharply. “You know girls do not go on elephant hunts.
If anyone from our hut went, it would be Mdingi.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I know,” answered Nomusa, softly.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why can’t you be happy with girls’ work like
Sisiwe and the others? What your father hears about
your skill and courage may please him, but it would
be better if he heard it about your brother than about
you. When it is time for you to marry, people will say,
‘I wonder how many cows Nomusa will have to give
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>for a husband,’ rather than how many cows a husband
will give for you.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa laughed. “I do not wish to marry at all.
I wish always to stay with you.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The mother smiled as she fed Bala clotted milk.
“Yes, yes, you think so now,” she replied.</p>

<p class='c003'>When Nomusa left the hut, Themba called eagerly,
“Are you going to play with me, Nomusa?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“No, I must weed our mother’s garden.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, tell me a story, then,” pleaded Themba.</p>

<p class='c003'>“When I come back. I shall take Dube with me,
and you play with Umpondo.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_106.jpg' alt='[Girl]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>When she returned, there was Themba waiting
for her. “What about my story?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, I am so tired now!” said Nomusa.</p>

<p class='c003'>“You can rest while you tell me the story,” Themba
suggested.</p>

<p class='c003'>“All right. Wait till I get a drink for Dube and
me.”</p>

<p class='c003'>When Nomusa came out, Themba quickly made
room for her next to him. “Well, what’s the story going
to be about?” he asked, eyes bright with anticipation.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa thought for a moment, wondering what
story to tell. “How would you like to hear about the
hyena that tried to eat the moon?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, I should like that,” Themba assured her.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Once upon a time,” said Nomusa, “a hyena
chanced upon a bone. She took it up in her jaws and
carried it away.</p>

<p class='c003'>“It happened that the moon was shining very
brightly and the water in the stream was very still. The
greedy hyena saw the moon’s reflection in the quiet
water. Thinking it was a fine big piece of meat, she
threw aside her bone in order to grasp it.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>“Into the water the hyena plunged her head. But
she withdrew it with her mouth empty. The water was
now disturbed, and the disappointed hyena could see
nothing.</p>

<p class='c003'>“She sat quietly on the bank, watching the stream.
The water became clear again and reflected the image
of the moon. The hyena made a fierce spring into the
stream, trying to grasp the moon and hold it fast. But
she seized only water and returned to the bank with
her jaws empty, while the stream became muddy again.</p>

<p class='c003'>“In the meantime, another hyena had picked up
the bone from the bank and had quietly gone away
with it. The first hyena kept on snapping at the water
until morning came and the moon grew pale and could
no longer be seen in the stream. Only then did the
hyena look for the bone she had thrown aside to grasp
for the moon. The bone was gone.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Day after day the angry hyena returned to the
stream, tramping the bank and muddying the water.
Everyone laughed as they saw her run into the stream
again and again, snapping and snapping her jaws and
catching only water.”</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Nomusa looked at Themba, who was leaning
drowsily against the hut. “Did you like the story?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Hm?” murmured Themba, rousing himself. “If
that is the end of the story, I have heard you tell better
ones. But thank you,” he added, rising. “I see Somcuba.
I am going to play <em>Ama-hu</em> with her.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The next morning when Nomusa and her mother
were preparing the food they heard an odd commotion
outdoors. They went out to see what it was about.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Look at Kangata!” cried Themba.</p>

<p class='c003'>Kangata was indeed a sight to see. His arms were
covered with red circles, and he carried branches of wild
cabbage in his arms.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_109.jpg' alt='[Children]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>“My father has chosen me to deliver an important
message to all the kraals in our neighborhood,” said
Kangata, proudly holding aloft his branches of wild
cabbage. “I am big now; so I am allowed to run and tell
them that the elephant hunt is to be two sleeps away.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“You must tell them where the hunters are to meet
and when,” advised Nomusa. “As soon as they see the
wild cabbage in your hand they will know your errand.
Remember you must not speak until you are asked.
Then tell when and where the hunters are to meet.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“And how does my boy-girl know all this?” asked
Makanya, amused. “It is a pity your father did not
choose you as messenger, since you know so well how
hunting messages should be given.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I know what to say,” Kangata assured them. “I
must go quickly to the other kraals and return in time
to help Mdingi with the cows.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c002'>Chief Zitu squatted on his special bamboo
mat in the hut of his wife Makanya. He sniffed the
food in the bowl Nomusa handed him.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I think I know what meat this is,” he said to
his wife.</p>

<p class='c003'>“It is Nomusa’s wild boar,” Makanya said, proudly.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I have heard about it.” Nomusa’s father looked at
her keenly. “It is a pity Nomusa is a girl, because she
would have made a good hunter. I could use another
strong, brave boy to help on this hunt.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“If I were allowed to go with you on the hunt, I
might be able to catch another boar for you on the
way,” Nomusa suggested, surprised at her own daring.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>“Nomusa! What are you saying!” reproved her
mother.</p>

<p class='c003'>But Zitu smiled good-naturedly and caught her
arm in his powerful hand, feeling her hard little muscles.
“Nomusa is strong—as strong as many boys older than
she is. And she is clever and brave.”</p>

<p class='c003'>He looked at his daughter again, and then at his
wife. “If Nomusa wishes, she may come on the hunt.
But she must be sure to cause me no shame.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa’s eyes widened with surprise. Makanya
was speechless. “Oh, my father, thank you!” Nomusa
burst out. “Please let me go with you, yes, yes!” She
turned to her mother. “I know Sisiwe will do some of
my work.”</p>

<p class='c003'>As if her father had already arranged everything,
he declared, “Mdingi lost the cow, and you found her,
so he will not go on the hunt this time. Kangata, of
course, is too young. Between your brothers and Sisiwe,
your mother will be able to get her work done.” Zitu
pushed away his bowl, saying, “I have finished.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Makanya handed him some white clay with which
to remove the grease from his fingers. When Nomusa
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>brought him the water gourd again, he rinsed his mouth
and with his fingers rubbed the food from his teeth. He
was clean again.</p>

<p class='c003'>The business of the hunt settled, Zitu gave his
attention to his wife and baby. Nomusa slipped quietly
out of the hut.</p>

<p class='c003'>She felt as if she would burst with joy and looked
for someone to tell. Themba was standing outside the
hut, looking lonely. To relieve her feelings, Nomusa
picked him up, pulled his hair gently, and turned him
upside down until his little pink heels wriggled in the
air. Themba squealed with delight, and Dube hopped
up and down, bewildered at this curious kind of play.</p>

<p class='c003'>Sisiwe came along, bearing vegetables from her
mother’s garden.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, Sisiwe,” Nomusa cried, “our father says I
may go on the elephant hunt!”</p>

<p class='c003'>Sisiwe was too surprised to say anything.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Will you take care of Dube for me while I am
gone?” Nomusa asked.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Of course, my sister,” Sisiwe answered. “And I
will help your mother, too,” she added generously. “Yo,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Nomusa, what do you think the other girls will say?”</p>

<p class='c003'>There were no preparations to make for the trip,
and the two days before the hunters were to meet were
very long ones for Nomusa. She would have liked to
talk about the hunt with her family. But she did not,
because she saw Mdingi was hurt because she was going
and he was not. Perhaps he really should be the one to
go. Still, her father had said plainly that Mdingi would
not be allowed to go, since he had lost the cow.</p>

<p class='c003'>Timidly she spoke to Mdingi about her feelings.
“I wish you were going on the hunt, my brother.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“It is no matter,” Mdingi said indifferently.</p>

<p class='c003'>But he was unhappy, Nomusa knew. How she
wished there were something she could do to help him!
If only Zitu knew how clever Mdingi was at composing
songs and stories, how much he knew about birds and
animals! And even so, he was a better shot with the
bow and arrow than most of the boys. He had proved
that at Damasi’s party.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was just that Mdingi did not care as a boy
should for shooting and hunting and such things. Still,
his pride was hurt when the chief chose his daughter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>to go with him on the elephant hunt instead of his son.</p>

<p class='c003'>At dawn on the morning of the departure, Nomusa
crept out of her hut very quietly, taking with her the
empty water jar. She would leave everything in readiness
for her mother when she awoke.</p>

<p class='c003'>There would be just time enough to fetch the
water, grind some mealie corn, and stir up the fire
before it would be time to leave.</p>

<p class='c003'>When she carried Dube over to Sisiwe’s hut, he
complained sleepily at being disturbed.</p>

<p class='c003'>“It is going to be hard for me to leave you, little
Dube,” Nomusa said to him.</p>

<p class='c003'>She fastened a cord to an outer post of Sisiwe’s
hut and attached the other end around Dube’s neck.
Then she gave him a bowl of <i><span lang="zu">amasi</span></i>, which he dearly
loved. Soon he began eating; the curds were too good
to ignore.</p>

<p class='c003'>While Dube ate, Nomusa looked in the direction
of her father’s hut to see if any of the hunters had yet
arrived. She saw two glistening hunters entering
through the kraal gate, their spears and large shields
held close to their bodies. Nomusa left Dube abruptly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>and ran back to her hut. She had forgotten to get a
handful of fat to rub on her body to make it glisten
like the bodies of the other hunters. She had heard that
fat made one active and supple.</p>

<p class='c003'>Rubbing and polishing herself did not take long.
Nomusa had done her work well, and she was ready to
leave the hut. With a final glance to see that all was
prepared for her mother when she awoke, she decided
that she could now leave. She had just got outside without
awakening any of her family when she heard an
insistent call. “Nomusa, wait!”</p>

<p class='c003'>Startled, she turned round and saw Mdingi with
a bow and arrows in his hand. Her heart leaped. Had
he determined to go and make her stay behind?</p>

<p class='c003'>“What is it?” asked Nomusa.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Here. Take these with you. You will need a good
weapon,” and he offered her the bow and arrows.</p>

<p class='c003'>“They are your best bow and arrows!” exclaimed
Nomusa, too surprised even to touch them.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Ay, but I want you to have them. I am disappointed
that I have to stay at home, but I am not
angry with you.”</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Overcome by Mdingi’s generosity, Nomusa did
not know what to say. She hesitated to take the offered
bow and arrows, but finally did so. “You are good, my
brother. I am sorry it is not you who will use the bow
and arrows. I shall take good care of them.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“It matters not about them. Only see to it that no
harm comes to <em>you</em>,” Mdingi said. “We shall be awaiting
your return.”</p>

<p class='c003'>He touched her arm affectionately and ran to the
cattle kraal without another word.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'><span class='fss'>TWELVE</span>: Off to the Hunt</h2>
</div>

<p class='c002'>Nomusa’s father had already come
out of his hut to greet the hunters who had coughed
their notice of arrival. He was standing in front of his
two tall neighbors, laughing and talking with them.</p>

<p class='c003'>As Nomusa came up to her father, carrying
Mdingi’s bow and arrows, she politely said, “<i><span lang="zu">Bayete!</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c003'>Zitu said proudly, “Here is Nomusa, my daughter.”
Then, looking at her with a twinkle in his eye, he added,
“She will show us how to catch wild boars. She is an
expert.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Those who were not going on the hunt were
already awakened by the noise of the hunters; they
hurried to stand a short distance off in order to watch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>what was going on. Although Themba could not see
his sister, Nomusa could see him staring, wide-eyed,
curious about all that was going on. More and more
hunters arrived with their dogs, until there were about
forty men and boys and a dozen dogs.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa heard one of the hunters saying, “I starved
my dog three days to make him keen for this hunt.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Ay,” answered another, “mine is like a hyena.
He has had no food for a long time, either. Are you
sure the bitter bark you told me to chew on the morning
of the hunt will strengthen my wind? So far I do
not feel its benefit.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yo! It has never failed,” said the first. “Look,
over there. Someone is sweeping one of the huts. Bad
luck! In our kraal, no one is allowed to sweep on the
morning of the hunt, lest we return empty-handed.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The moment Nomusa heard this, she was filled
with such dread at this bad omen that she crept out
between the long black legs of the hunters, ran to
Themba, and said, “Go quickly and tell Somcuba’s
sister that there must be no sweeping on the morning
of the hunt, or we shall have bad luck.”</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>Themba hurried off to carry out Nomusa’s order.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_120.jpg' alt='[Family]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Now that all the hunters had assembled, they
formed little bands of relatives or close neighbors. First
they began by saluting their chief, dancing before him.
Each group danced and rushed around the kraal, yelling
and boasting of their courage and strength. Then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>they formed a huge circle around their chief and stood
respectfully before him.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa’s father began to instruct them as to their
positions in the hunt. Every time he finished a sentence,
the hunters would strike on the ground with their
spears and shout, “<i><span lang="zu">Tshilo!</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c003'>Zitu said, “You all know the rules of the hunt, but
in case anyone has forgotten, I shall tell you again
that the first man to draw the blood of the prey is the
owner. The next man to stab it can claim a leg, and if
it is necessary for a third to strike, he may have a shoulder.
The chief receives a leg from every animal.” He
looked around with a severe expression to see if everyone
was paying attention, and continued. “If a small
animal is killed, the hunter who has killed it must immediately
carry it to me and claim it as his own. In
this way there can be no quarrels. You have all heard?”</p>

<p class='c003'>There were loud calls of “<em>Yo!</em>” “<i><span lang="zu">Hau!</span></i>” “It is understood.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“We go now,” said Nomusa’s father.</p>

<p class='c003'>A happy murmur rose through the crowd, accompanied
by the clink of metal weapons as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>hunters arranged their shields, spears, bows and arrows,
and liana ropes. The journey began.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa could hardly believe they were really on
their way. Filing out of the kraal close behind Zitu, she
turned her head hastily to see if she could catch a last
glimpse of Dube. Perhaps Sisiwe was in the crowd,
holding the little monkey, but Nomusa’s view was
blocked by a solid wall of moving men. It was hopeless
to try to see anything behind them.</p>

<p class='c003'>As they marched along, the warming rays of the
rising sun fell on the dew-soaked ground which looked
so green and fresh. The wet grass swished damply
against the hunters’ naked bodies. Nomusa wondered
what the elephant country would be like. Would it be
as rolling, would there be as many narrow little streams,
would there be wide meadows? Nomusa had never been
further than Damasi’s kraal on its flat-topped hill. She
had often tried to imagine what the country might be
like far beyond. That there were places where there
were eland, lions, elephants, inyala, sassaby, and springbok
she knew from having heard stories of previous
hunts. She had heard that there was even a world of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>water called an ocean, if one kept walking east as far
as one could go.</p>

<p class='c003'>The hunters talked and laughed, now and then
pointing to some indistinct moving object off in the
distance. Their curiosity and laughter were easily aroused.
It interested Nomusa to see how playful these
grown men were. They behaved no more seriously than
her small brothers. Only her father remained dignified,
walking ahead with a long stride, eyes alert, ears keen.</p>

<p class='c003'>After Nomusa had walked behind him for some
time, Zitu unexpectedly turned his head in her direction
as if he had suddenly remembered that Nomusa
was with them. He looked at her and said, “We have
far to go. I hope you do not tire easily.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“That I do not,” answered Nomusa, looking into
Zitu’s friendly eyes. At the moment it was difficult to
imagine how fierce and angry he could be. Should she
dare to ask him how far they were to walk before they
reached elephant country? It would be useful to know,
so that she would not be expecting to see elephants
crash out at them all along the way. Not that she was
afraid, but it was good to know what to expect.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>“Come, Nomusa. Walk along beside me,” suggested
her father. “It will make it easier for you if you
have anything to ask.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Quickly Nomusa ran forward, trying to match her
step to his. She thought her father even slowed up a
little so that she would not have to take little running
steps to keep up with him.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Is it far to the elephant country?” asked Nomusa.</p>

<p class='c003'>“It is about five sleeps away,” Zitu answered, his
eyes on the path ahead. “It may be nearer or farther
than that. Much depends on whether herds of elephants
are moving south or north, and whether we walk along
speedily and without any mishap. We are headed for
some high country and wide rivers where elephants like
to wander.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa listened carefully. That was just what she
wanted to know. Proudly she walked, letting nothing
escape her notice. Oh, there was a crested crane! She
had never seen one before, but she knew what it was.
“Look, Father!” urged Nomusa excitedly.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Not good to eat,” Zitu replied, indifferent.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_124.jpg' alt='[Bird]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa was about to say that she had pointed it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>out for its beauty and not as something to eat, but she
checked herself. Perhaps hunters should not think of
things along the way except as a possibility for food or
for exchange, like elephants’ tusks.</p>

<p class='c003'>She now walked along silently, thinking of the red
bush lily she saw in one place, of the grassland flowers
she saw in another. The farther they walked from the
kind of country she was used to, the more different trees
and wild flowers she saw. She must remember to tell
Sisiwe about the gladioli she saw growing wild next to
that narrow stream at which they stopped to drink. She
would hardly believe it. And the birds! Even Mdingi
had never seen so many. A flying hammerkopf attracted
her attention as it snapped up frogs in a marshy pool.</p>

<p class='c003'>After some distance, Nomusa saw her father wiping
his perspiring brow with the back of his hand. “The sun
is high,” he declared. “In a little while we must stop
to eat and rest until the sun’s rays are not so hot.”</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/i_125.jpg' alt='[Bird]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c003'>When they reached a clear running stream, the
chief turned and called to the hunters, “Here! A good
place for eating and resting.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Immediately all came together, and as if they had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>already agreed on what was to be done, some left to
go off into the woods to look for small animals, others
began gathering brushwood for a fire. Several took out
of a small sack some mealies and yams.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa looked at everything with the liveliest
interest. She quenched her thirst in the swiftly moving
stream and then hurried to help carry twigs and
branches to the blazing fire. Zabala, Damasi, and the
other boys did their share of the work, obeying the
orders of the older hunters.</p>

<p class='c003'>Before long the hunters returned one by one with
rabbits, partridges, some quail, and a guinea hen, which
they set to cleaning and roasting.</p>

<p class='c003'>As they waited for the food to cook, Nomusa
rested. Soon Damasi came to her, holding two half-cooked
partridge legs. “For you,” he said, offering
Nomusa one.</p>

<p class='c003'>When everyone had eaten, the hunters lay on the
grassy bank under the protecting shade of tall plane
trees. They rested or slept until Zitu gave the signal to
start off again.</p>

<p class='c003'>Towards evening Nomusa felt so weary as she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>trudged along that she could hardly wait for her father
to call a halt. And though she did not like to admit it,
even to herself, distant sounds of animals half frightened
her. She heard the hoarse growl of a lion and barks
she could not identify. Nomusa looked at the others,
but they went on as if they had heard nothing. With
the early moon climbing high over the horizon, there
was still plenty of light to walk by so long as they kept
to the open spaces. At last, however, it was necessary to
stop, for a dark wood lay in front of them which the
moon’s rays could not penetrate. Zitu called a halt.</p>

<p class='c003'>Now a very large fire was made. It would not be
used only for cooking and warming purposes; it would
have to last all through the night to keep away prowling
animals, as well. Tonight there was no time for any
of them to hunt for food, and they depended on what
they still had in their sacks of mealies and yams. The
food, though not plentiful, was filling; and when each
had eaten his share, he lay down to sleep, close to the
fire. Nomusa was glad to hear Zitu appoint one of the
hunters as sentinel.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa was lying on her back looking up into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>star-studded sky, wondering how far they were from
their kraal, when she saw something moving high up
in the trees. Her heart thumped wildly. She was about
to move over quietly to warn her father, when she saw
the leaves stir again. A baboon! <em>Hau!</em> There was another,
holding a baby. A baboon family was nesting in the tree.</p>

<p class='c003'>Suddenly there was a muffled squeal as one of the
mothers slapped her baby and grabbed it by the hair
on the back of its head. Apparently it had put something
in its mouth that it should not have. The mother
baboon stuck her finger into the baby’s mouth and
pried out what it was eating. The howl from the baby
caused dozing hunters to reach for their weapons. Then
they saw the baboons, and one said, “They will not
bother us if we do not bother them.”</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/i_128.jpg' alt='[Bird]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c003'>A loud bark came from the father baboon. He
seemed to be scolding and saying, “Stop that awful
noise!” The cries ceased, and all was still in the baboon
family once more. Everything seemed safe and peaceful,
and Nomusa fell asleep.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>
<img src='images/i_129.jpg' alt='[Huts]' class='ig001'>
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'><span class='fss'>THIRTEEN</span>: An Unexpected Feast</h2>
</div>

<p class='c002'>The following morning the direction the
hunters took led them toward high land. The air was
gray and a little misty. Out of the mist Nomusa heard
a voice calling out to her. It was Damasi’s. His teeth
flashed white as he smiled at Nomusa. They walked
along side by side, saying little; the long climb made
them both rather short of breath.</p>

<p class='c003'>“It is a long way to the elephant country,” Nomusa
said at last.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes,” Damasi replied. “Some say five sleeps away,
some say more.”</p>

<p class='c003'>By noonday they were high up in the hills. Below
them they saw the rolling, grassy plains. The hot rays
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>of the sun were beginning to make the air before
Nomusa’s eyes appear in crooked, glassy waves.</p>

<p class='c003'>When the hunting party reached a waterfall that
cascaded over boulders to the rocks and plains below,
Zitu ordered a halt. Nomusa hoped it was so that they
might eat. She was not used to going without food for
such long periods. At home, when the children were
hungry, they ate. There was always enough.</p>

<p class='c003'>While Nomusa and Damasi and the other boys
set to work finding dry twigs and branches with which
to start a fire, the older hunters cooled their perspiring
bodies under the waterfall. They laughed and enjoyed
themselves immensely, shouting and splashing each
other.</p>

<p class='c003'>However, when they saw the fire well under way,
the men quickly came out from under the waterfall.
Taking their weapons they went to look for game.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa and Damasi and Zabala took their turn
under the splashing water. Emerging cool and refreshed,
they stood in the sun to dry their dripping bodies.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa was looking at the plain below when
something caught her eye. It looked like a black ball
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>and a brown ball moving horizontally across the skyline
at great speed, apparently without touching the
earth. They became bigger, blacker, and browner as
they moved closer.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Look, Damasi!” she cried. “What can that be?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Damasi looked in the direction Nomusa pointed
to, puzzled for a moment. Then he said: “I know!
Ostriches! A male and a female. They must have been
frightened by something. They are galloping so fast we
cannot see their legs.” Damasi looked at Nomusa,
laughing. “We might wish we could run as fast if some
wild animal were chasing us.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_131.jpg' alt='[Children]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>The barking of dogs heralded the return of the
hunters. They had had good luck, and now everyone
fell to cleaning and preparing the birds and animals
for cooking. After the meal they slept. It seemed to
Nomusa that she had barely lain down when there
came urgent calls to get up and march on.</p>

<p class='c003'>There was no time for an extra stretch or another
wink. When her father said, “We go!” he meant it.
The hunters had already extinguished the fire.</p>

<p class='c003'>Toward evening they found themselves on a
scrubby plain dotted with old thorn trees. Nomusa
admired the reddened sky, flushed by the quick and
beautiful sunset. The sunsets never failed to leave her
astonished by the vivid coloring that faded swiftly into
gray, then almost black. It was a marvel how quickly
the sunset was over. Down went the sun into the mysterious
horizon like a stone dropped in a pool.</p>

<p class='c003'>The shadows became heavier and blacker. The
hunters grew more watchful. This was the kind of
country lions liked to roam.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa hoped her father would not decide to
spend the night on this unpleasant-looking plain. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>could not help feeling it was dangerous. But how much
farther could they walk in the darkness? The dogs
whined uneasily and drew close to their masters.</p>

<p class='c003'>All at once the hunters who led the way stopped.
There was a sudden hush, and the men held their
weapons ready.</p>

<p class='c003'>What was it that had stopped them? Nomusa looked
up at her father questioningly, but he was too concerned
with something under a large thorn tree to
notice her. Zabala and Damasi, now boldly in front,
were pointing at something very long and thick lying
on the ground. It bulged in the middle, with two high
knobs jutting under its flesh.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_133.jpg' alt='[Children]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>The object did not move. Whatever it was, it seemed
to be dead. Now the hunters moved closer, step by
step, holding back the excited dogs.</p>

<p class='c003'>As they drew nearer, Nomusa saw that the object
was a huge snake that had swallowed some small animal.</p>

<p class='c003'>“The snake is dead,” announced her father. “Let
us cut him open and see what he has swallowed.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The snake was carefully cut open right around the
part that bulged. There lay a young spotted deer,
completely intact, that had apparently been swallowed
not very long before. The two knobs under the snake’s
skin were the deer’s budding horns.</p>

<p class='c003'>Damasi came running over to Nomusa. “Do you
see what has happened?” he asked excitedly. “The
snake must have swallowed the young deer and then
lain quietly down to digest it. When he fell asleep the
horns of the deer ripped through his flesh and killed
him. What a feast we shall have tonight!”</p>

<p class='c003'>And what a fine story this is going to make for
Themba, thought Nomusa.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I have not tasted deer meat for a long time,” said
Damasi, smacking his lips.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>“It is a pity that I am not as hungry now as I was
at noonday,” Nomusa sighed.</p>

<p class='c003'>Zitu ordered an extra large fire to be made. Not
far from the dead snake the hunters roasted the deer,
pleased over their good luck in finding such a magnificent
supper with so little effort. They gorged themselves
with food as if they had not eaten for days, and even
Nomusa could not resist the delicious smells of the
roasting deer meat.</p>

<p class='c003'>Sentinels were now appointed to watch over them
while they slept, and a large crackling fire was kept
burning to ward off any wild animals and to warm the
hunters when the night grew cold. Nomusa did not
enjoy having to sleep on this plain, especially as the
dead snake was near enough to attract jackals or hyenas
to their neighborhood.</p>

<p class='c003'>She stared into the leaping flames, determined not
to fall asleep. She would be a self-appointed sentinel
tonight. Two would not be too many. But the warmth
of the fire and her overburdened stomach conquered
her determination to stay awake. Nomusa slept peacefully
until sunrise the next morning.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'><span class='fss'>FOURTEEN</span>: Elephant Country</h2>
</div>

<p class='c002'>“Today we are in elephant country.”
Zitu’s words were loud enough for everyone to hear,
though he spoke to Nomusa, who was walking by his
side. “I expect we shall see elephant tracks before
sunset.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“You were right then, my father,” Nomusa said
admiringly, “when you first told me the elephants were
five sleeps away.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I have been here before—many times,” the chief
replied. “Usually elephants stay in about the same
places. It was not any special wisdom on my part that
I should know this.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa was proud that her father, though an
important Zulu chief, never pretended to know more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>than he actually did. She had heard of chiefs who
claimed to have mysterious sources of knowledge and
power, who were haughty and imperious with their
people. Sometimes they were cruel, too. But not Zitu.
He was simple and just. Although as chief he was entitled
to a larger share of whatever came to them, he
never took more than an ordinary Zulu.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa and her father were passing a grove of
trees when she called: “See, over there! How strange
those trees are! Why do they have no bark on them?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Zitu looked where Nomusa pointed. It was as she
said. There were trees without bark, or with large strips
of it peeling off and hanging limply to the ground. Even
the sides of some of the trees looked worn down.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yo! Elephants have been using this grove,” exclaimed
Zitu. “You have sharp eyes, my daughter.” He
looked keenly at the trees and the ground around them.
Several of the smaller trees had been uprooted, and
not a blade of grass remained. Nomusa saw the enormous
footprints of the elephants in the soft earth.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Hear me!” Zitu spoke in a very serious tone, and
the hunters listened to him with respectful attention.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>“Now that we are really in elephant country, we
must be more cautious than ever before. Those of you
who have never been on an elephant hunt do not know
how dangerous it can be.</p>

<p class='c003'>“A few years ago, Caluza, one of our bravest
hunters, was killed and two others were badly wounded
by an enraged elephant. We came upon a herd that had
smelled us before we knew where they were. The first
thing we heard was their furious trumpeting; then
suddenly we saw them, waving their trunks and fanning
out their great ears menacingly.</p>

<p class='c003'>“With no further warning they charged us. We
leaped to one side to throw our spears at the beasts.
But one elephant seized Caluza with his trunk. He
dashed him over and over against a tree until there
was no life in him. Then he threw him down and
trampled his body horribly.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Zitu paused, looking at the ring of faces. “We took
back tusks from that hunt,” he said slowly, “but we
paid too dearly for them. Let us hope there will be no
sorrow in the kraals when we return from this hunt.</p>

<p class='c003'>“We must find the elephants before they find us.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>And each one must do his part at just the right time.
One more thing: we must not kill an elephant too close
to the river, for then he will fall in the water and we
shall never get the tusks.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Use your eyes and use your ears! We go now.”</p>

<p class='c003'>As they started Zabala came running to his father.
“Look over here!”</p>

<p class='c003'>Zabala had found the path by which the elephants
entered and left the grove. It was smooth and hard; they
must have used it many times.</p>

<p class='c003'>“These tracks are not fresh. I think it is many days
since the elephants visited this grove,” said one of the
hunters. “The droppings look old.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Let us go in that direction,” Zitu decided, pointing
the way. “And quietly. Hold your weapons ready
but do not use them until I give the signal.”</p>

<p class='c003'>As they moved along the path, Nomusa wondered
how many elephants they would find at one time, how
they would manage to get an elephant back to their
kraal, how she would succeed in hitting an elephant
with Mdingi’s arrow in just the right spot to kill it. Her
mind was so full of these thoughts that she did not look
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>carefully in front of her. All at once she stepped on a
bunch of dry twigs, making such a loud snapping noise
that the hunters were startled. They turned angrily,
frowning at Nomusa.</p>

<p class='c003'>Zitu said quietly: “We do not want anyone to
say that this is what happens when we take a girl along.
Such a noise might drive the elephants at us or away
from us entirely. Let them but smell or hear us and
things might go badly! One person’s carelessness can
endanger us all. Do not let it happen again.”</p>

<p class='c003'>As if her father had to tell her that! Nomusa was
overwhelmed by her feeling of disgrace. Zitu would
know better than to take a girl with him another time.</p>

<p class='c003'>On went the hunters, paying no further attention
to Nomusa. She walked along in their midst, her eyes
fast to the ground, still filled with shame. After a while
she felt a gentle nudge at her elbow. At first she paid
no attention to it, thinking one of the hunters had accidentally
bumped her. But when the nudge became
more insistent, she looked up and saw Damasi. He
grinned sympathetically and offered her some wild figs.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa felt too unhappy to take any, and she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>solemnly shook her head in refusal. Damasi did not
press her, but began eating them himself. They continued
walking side by side for some time. Then
Nomusa turned her head to see if Damasi had left any
figs for her. He caught her glance and rubbed his
middle enthusiastically to show how good the figs had
been. He held out an empty hand and pointed down
his throat to show where the plump figs had gone.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa’s disappointed look amused Damasi, and
he could not help laughing. She decided that he was a
greedy boy, no different from all the others.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/i_141.jpg' alt='[Men]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c003'>But soon Damasi nudged her again and teasingly
showed her the same handful of figs he had held out
to her the first time. Despite herself, Nomusa smiled.
Damasi had only pretended he had eaten them. This
time she did not risk refusing the figs, but took them
eagerly. She gave back half to Damasi, and together
they walked on, eating cheerfully. By now Nomusa had
forgotten her disgrace, but she did not forget to be careful.</p>

<p class='c003'>Just before noon, the elephant path they were
following disappeared into the grassy plains.</p>

<p class='c003'>“This is the time to take greatest care,” Zitu said,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>and the word was passed quietly among the hunters.
They moved slowly and noiselessly, searching for new
elephant tracks.</p>

<p class='c003'>As they approached a wide deep river, they heard
loud splashing sounds. The hunters stood still for a
moment, listening; then they moved on silently toward
the river.</p>

<p class='c003'>As they drew closer, the splashing sound grew
louder. Their view of the water was hidden by what
looked like a wall of large, light blue butterflies, hundreds
and hundreds of them, fluttering up and down
all the way from the ground to a height taller than the
tallest hunter.</p>

<p class='c003'>The chief signaled to the hunters to creep behind
some bushes so they would not have to part the butterfly
wall to see the river. As she came noiselessly from
behind the bushes, Nomusa was surprised and delighted
to see a mother elephant pushing her baby elephant into
the water for a bath. The baby did not want to go in,
but the determined mother was shoving it into the river
with her trunk.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the meantime, the father elephant, quite unconcerned,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>was giving himself a shower bath by sucking
up great quantities of water through his trunk and then
squirting it—<em>swooshh!</em>—over his back. Again and again
the huge bull elephant did this. He was having a
wonderful time. The corners of his mouth were pulled
back, and his eyes were partly closed as he sprayed the
water over his massive head.</p>

<p class='c003'>The cow elephant finally succeeded in pushing her
baby into the water, and she blew a shower of water
over it. The little one tried to escape by scrambling up
the bank. Some of the hunters raised their spears, prepared
to hurl them as soon as their chief gave the sign.</p>

<p class='c003'>But Zitu signaled the hunters not to throw their
spears at the elephants. Nomusa was surprised, and
strangely happy, too. The chief pointed to the elephant
tusks and showed with his hands that they were too
small. Now Nomusa understood. They had not come
to hunt elephants just to kill them, but to obtain the
largest tusks possible. She remembered now that she
had heard that white traders were very glad to get large
elephant tusks and that good exchanges were made
for them.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>
<img src='images/i_144.jpg' alt='[Elephants]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The little elephant seemed very content to be in
the water now, and he splashed and spluttered as much
as his father and mother. In a mischievous moment, the
baby sucked up a great trunkful of water and blew it
full in his father’s face. Astonished and irritated, the
bull elephant rushed at his disrespectful offspring. He
pushed him into such deep water that he lost his foothold.</p>

<p class='c003'>Frightened, the little elephant lifted his short trunk
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>into the air and trumpeted frantically while he swam
to shallower water. At last he scrambled safely to shore.
He had learned how to behave toward his father.</p>

<p class='c003'>The hunters moved on until they were far from
the river scene. Then they stopped to eat.</p>

<p class='c003'>They rested for a while; then Zitu rose. “We must
be on our way. We are in the neighborhood of elephants,
and I do not want to spend the night in their
midst without locating some with good tusks.”</p>

<p class='c003'>After they had walked for some distance, Zitu
stood still, listening. The men stopped, waiting for their
chief’s decision. In the dismal hush different calls of
forest birds could be heard, mingled with an occasional
howl from some animal. Then faintly there came to
their ears the sound of low rumblings and gurglings.
Nomusa pointed urgently in the direction from which
the sound had come. Her father nodded, now smiling.
He had heard too, and so had all the others.</p>

<p class='c003'>Very, very carefully they moved in the direction
of the sound, weapons ready. While they crept closer,
stopping from time to time in order to keep away from
the wind side, Zabala’s arm suddenly waved up and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>down in a frenzy as he saw something moving between
two tall trees. A large ear could be seen flapping slowly.
Yo! They had come upon a herd of elephants feeding.
The hunters stood stock-still, their eyes wide with
excitement.</p>

<p class='c003'>When Zitu decided which elephants they would
attack, he pointed out to each of his men what position
to take. Nomusa wormed her way forward after Zabala
and Damasi. She peeped through the screen of leaves
to see the enormous creatures whose ears seemed to
flap among the topmost branches of the trees.</p>

<p class='c003'>Eight elephants were in the clearing, three of
them bulls, four cow elephants, and one baby elephant,
a very small one indeed. Nomusa drew back stealthily
and held up eight fingers to show her father how many
elephants she had seen. The hunters nodded their
heads, well pleased with the information.</p>

<p class='c003'>Zitu crept forward and peered through the bushes.
He had to find out which elephants had the best tusks.
Nomusa looked again when her father did, and now she
saw a sight that delighted her. The baby elephant was
under her mother, trying to suck some milk from her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>while the mother was grazing. The mother elephant
kept pushing the little one out from under her, but her
persistent baby would not stay away.</p>

<p class='c003'>It amazed Nomusa to see the size of the bulls.
They were huge, bigger than anything she had ever
seen. While they ate, their stomachs rumbled, and they
slobbered with their mouths and ground their teeth.
None of the beasts ever seemed to stand still. They
were constantly moving and shifting their feet, flapping
their great ears.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_147.jpg' alt='[Elephants]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Two of the bull elephants had especially large,
heavy tusks. These were the ones Zitu pointed out to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>his men. They got into positions from which they could
get a better view of the herd and a closer aim. Unless
they hit the elephants in exactly the right spot, they
would not be able to kill them. Nomusa knew that a
wounded elephant is a ferocious beast. These next few
moments would be extremely dangerous ones. Her
heart began to pound so hard she was afraid the elephants
would hear it.</p>

<p class='c003'>The chief now made a quick sign. With all their
strength and skill the hunters hurled their sharp-pointed
spears at the two bull elephants. Nomusa’s bow twanged
as she let her arrow fly, aiming for the vulnerable spot
under the elephant’s ear. Zabala and Damasi hurled
their short spears.</p>

<p class='c003'>A great uproar set up among the elephants.
Trumpeting and screaming, their heads up and tails
held out stiffly, they charged the bushes where the
hunters lay hidden.</p>

<p class='c003'>Suddenly there was a great thud, and unexpectedly
the herd turned in the opposite direction and thundered
off. After a moment the hunters crept out of their hiding
place to see what had happened.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>One of the huge bull elephants lay on its side, a
mountain of flesh enclosed in a gray wrinkled skin.
Nomusa and the others stared at the enormous mass,
hardly able to believe they had killed this giant.</p>

<p class='c003'>“We were very lucky,” said Zitu. “I think I know
what happened. As the herd charged at us, this one fell
dead in its path. That turned the others.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The chief rubbed his hand along the handsome
tusks of the dead elephant. “They are fine tusks.”</p>

<p class='c003'>In the meantime Nomusa and Damasi had been
looking at the path made by the herd as they rushed off.
Small trees had been uprooted and great branches
broken off others. Nomusa stared at the ground.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Look!” she cried. “A trail of blood!”</p>

<p class='c003'>“The other elephant must have been very badly
wounded,” Zitu said, crouching down to examine
the tracks.</p>

<p class='c003'>He stood up, looking at the sun. “It grows late,” he
said, concern in his voice. “But if we do not find the
wounded bull today, we may never do so.</p>

<p class='c003'>“We must follow him now,” the chief decided; and
he led the way.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>
<img src='images/i_150.jpg' alt='[Huts]' class='ig001'>
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'><span class='fss'>FIFTEEN</span>: A Wounded Bull</h2>
</div>

<p class='c002'>The trail of blood was easy to follow at
first, but it was not very long before Nomusa understood
why Zitu was worried. The sun was sinking
deeper and deeper, and Nomusa remembered how
quickly darkness came after sunset.</p>

<p class='c003'>From time to time they came to large patches of
flattened grass where the wounded elephant had fallen,
to rise again and move on.</p>

<p class='c003'>The hunters kept their eyes on the ground, and
their ears were keenly alert to all the sounds about
them. They knew how dangerous a wounded bull elephant
could be, and other fierce animals might be
prowling.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>It became more and more difficult to see the trail
of the animal, and Nomusa began to fear night would
fall before they found him.</p>

<p class='c003'>Then Sihkulumi, one of the hunters in the lead,
stopped dead in his tracks, pointing.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Hau!” he said. “There he is!”</p>

<p class='c003'>Ahead of them they saw the wounded elephant
lying against a tree that seemed to bend with his
huge weight.</p>

<p class='c003'>“He is dead!” Sihkulumi cried, and he rushed
forward. Zitu spoke a restraining word; then he raced
after Sihkulumi.</p>

<p class='c003'>Even as the hunter reached him, the elephant
heaved his huge bulk upright. His trunk shot out,
enveloping Sihkulumi. He would surely be killed,
crushed to death by the powerful trunk.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa saw her father, fearfully close to the elephant,
taking sure aim. Then his bow twanged, and
the arrow sped to the elephant’s brain.</p>

<p class='c003'>The beast dropped dead, and Sihkulumi’s body
fell to the ground. Zitu was beside him in a moment.
Soon Sihkulumi sat up, not hurt, only shaken and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>frightened. But he could not look at the chief, and
when he spoke his voice was full of shame.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I was not worth risking your life for,” he said.
“If I had remembered to wait for your orders, there
would have been no danger.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Zitu helped him to his feet. “I am thankful that
you are alive,” he said simply. “I believe you will never
be foolish again.”</p>

<p class='c003'>He turned to the others. “We shall stay here tonight.
We shall need a very large fire to frighten away
animals.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa went about gathering wood with the
others, but she could not forget the sight of Zitu as he
faced the elephant. This was a story that would be told
about the evening fires for many moons.</p>

<p class='c003'>The hunters cut off great chunks of elephant meat
to roast over the fire. What a feast they had! Nomusa
was surprised to discover how good the meat tasted.
But it was very tough to chew. When everyone had
eaten as much as he wanted, Zitu chose the first sentry
for the night, and all lay down to sleep.</p>

<p class='c003'>What animals howled or roared through the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>night, only the sentinels knew. Nomusa and the other
weary hunters were awakened at dawn the next morning,
greeted by the smell of roasting elephant meat.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the morning the men started the difficult task
of cutting the huge tusks out of the elephant’s jaw. It
took hours and hours. But at last they were out and
lying side by side on the ground, where everyone
admired their size and beauty. Then Zitu appointed
two men to carry each tusk. “Everyone take turns,”
the chief said.</p>

<p class='c003'>As they marched, Nomusa began to feel very
tired and thirsty. Her head ached and throbbed, and
although the day was not hot, she felt as if she were
burning. And how unbearably thirsty she was!</p>

<p class='c003'>Insect bites and sores on her body which she had
received along the way, and to which she had paid little
attention, now seemed very troublesome. Still, she was
determined that she would not make Zitu regret taking
her on this hunt. Not a word would she say about
being thirsty and tired. But she had lost interest in elephants
and in anything that was to be seen along the
trail. Her only thought was of her longing for water and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>a place to lie down. How she wished she were with her
mother. Makanya would be sure to know what to do
to make her feel better.</p>

<p class='c003'>Finally Nomusa could go no farther. She would
have to stop no matter what happened. The others
could go on without her.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa lay down on a grassy slope, hidden by the
long grass. She closed her eyes. The hunters filed past
without knowing she was lying there. How long she
lay there Nomusa did not know. She must have fallen
asleep.</p>

<p class='c003'>She lay like a stone on the earth; then she became
dimly aware of someone bending over her and saying,
“Are you sick, Nomusa?” The voice sounded far away.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa opened her eyes. “Oh, Damasi,” she said
weakly, “I am very tired, and so thirsty.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“We have come to a little stream, not far from
here, where we are all bathing and resting. Come,”
he urged.</p>

<p class='c003'>“You were good to come back for me,” murmured
Nomusa.</p>

<p class='c003'>“It was not I who thought of it first,” admitted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>Damasi. “While we were sitting at the stream your
father suddenly missed you and asked me to go back
and look for you. Let us go. I shall help you.”</p>

<p class='c003'>When they came to the hunters, Damasi took
Nomusa directly to her father. “Sit here,” Zitu said.
“Damasi, bring water.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Out of a pouch in his belt Zitu took some powdered
herbs, which he mixed with water. It was a bitter
drink, and Nomusa shuddered as she swallowed it.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Now rest,” her father said gently.</p>

<p class='c003'>As she drank more water Nomusa began to grow
comfortably warm, and her cold sweat turned to warm
perspiration. “Ah, that is well,” said her father as he
felt her brow. “You will feel better now. I think you
did not chew the elephant meat well enough. The
first time I ate elephant meat I felt ill, too.” It comforted
Nomusa to hear this.</p>

<p class='c003'>Before long Nomusa felt quite strong again; she
was ready to get up and go along. When Zitu saw
this, he gave the signal to start.</p>

<p class='c003'>“It is not very far from here where we left the
first elephant,” he said.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>Nomusa kept a sharp lookout, hoping to be the
first to see it. But it was Zitu’s keen eyes that found
the animal. The chief stopped, frowning.</p>

<p class='c003'>“<em>Hau!</em>” he cried. “What is this?”</p>

<p class='c003'>There, swarming over the elephant like black ants,
were many tiny dark people. Who were they and what
were they doing on her father’s elephant? Nomusa
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>wondered. There would certainly be trouble now.
Nomusa saw the faces of her father and the other
hunters fill with anger. Chief Zitu shouted, “We killed
this elephant! It belongs to us!”</p>

<p class='c003'>The small people answered in a storm of words
none of the Zulus understood. Threateningly they picked
up their toylike bows and arrows. The Zulu hunters
raised their spears, ready to use them at a word from
their chief. Nomusa was excited and afraid too. There
would surely be a terrible fight.</p>

<p class='c003'>But Zitu spoke to them again, in a quieter tone.
He made signs with his hands, saying that he and his
men must have the tusks, but the little people could
have the rest of the elephant. At last they understood,
and they laid down their weapons, to the great relief
of all. The Zulus, too, dropped their weapons on the
ground and slowly approached the dead elephant.</p>

<p class='c003'>The small people began cutting open the huge
animal. As Nomusa watched, she saw how carefully
they pulled out the eyelashes and the long hairs from
the elephant’s ears. They seemed to treasure these
especially. Some of them were cutting off chunks of elephant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>meat and eating it raw. How sick they will be!
thought Nomusa.</p>

<p class='c003'>Full of curiosity about these small people, Nomusa
drew near her father and asked, “My father, who are
these strange people? They do not seem at all like us.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“They are Pygmies, who live in the forest here,”
Zitu replied. “Only once before have I ever met any,
and that was when we had gone on a hunt ten sleeps
away. These Pygmies have wandered a long distance
from their home, far to the north.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa kept her eyes fixed on the fascinating little
people. She noticed that the tallest among them was
just a little taller than she was. They were lighter in
color than the Zulus, and much hairier.</p>

<p class='c003'>While the hunters were hacking out the elephant’s
tusks, Nomusa stayed close to the Pygmies so she could
learn as much as possible about them. They wore nothing
but a small flap of eland skin below their fat bellies
and had no ornaments of any kind. To Nomusa they
looked very drab and bare without beads or bracelets.
Their arms seemed too long for their bodies; their legs
were short; their feet were very large. But their toes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>were the most remarkable of all. They were so long
that they looked more like fingers than toes. How
wonderful they must be for climbing trees! thought
Nomusa.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Pygmies moved quickly and seemed to have
a natural cleverness in doing things. Nomusa felt
much attracted to the little people when she saw how
merry and playful they were, how helpful and kind to
each other.</p>

<p class='c003'>Some of them had made a fire and were smoking
large chunks of elephant meat on pointed sticks. Others
crawled inside the elephant and cut out the heart and
liver, handing them to others on the outside.</p>

<p class='c003'>After a while Nomusa noticed that from time to
time a few Pygmies would disappear into the forest,
carrying smoked meat on long sticks. She wondered
where they went. Perhaps her father would let her
follow them.</p>

<p class='c003'>But this was no time to ask for a favor. Zitu was
busy, and he did not like working with so many Pygmies
swarming about him. They got in his way so that
it was difficult to move without bumping into one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>them. The little people were as curious about the Zulus
as Nomusa was about the Pygmies.</p>

<p class='c003'>When she saw her father looking more cheerful,
Nomusa went to him and said, “My father, I am very
curious about these small people and how they live.
May I follow one of them when he goes into the forest?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Zitu was silent for a moment, and Nomusa thought
he was angry at her foolish request. But he only turned
his head and called: “Sikhulumi! Come!”</p>

<p class='c003'>Sikhulumi came quickly, and Zitu said: “My
daughter wants to see where the Pygmies live. Go with
her and look after her. You know a little of their
language.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Sikhulumi nodded gravely. The tall hunter was
pleased and proud that the chief entrusted him with
such an errand, especially after his recklessness of the
day before.</p>

<p class='c003'>Zitu added, smiling: “Nomusa seems very much
interested in these little people. Perhaps you can find
her a husband among them.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Sikhulumi laughed, and Nomusa made a face.</p>

<p class='c003'>As one of the Pygmies started off with a load, Zitu
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>tapped his shoulder. Smiling, he pointed to Nomusa.
The Pygmy grinned, looking at Nomusa with great
interest; but they could see he did not understand
what was meant. Sikhulumi said a few words in the
Pygmy language. The Pygmy finally smiled and nodded
his head. He would guide them to the place where
his people lived.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'><span class='fss'>SIXTEEN</span>: The Pygmy Settlement</h2>
</div>

<p class='c002'>Nomusa and Sikhulumi followed the
little man through the dense forest. He walked swiftly
and quietly, half running through bushes and under
low branches. There was no path, and Nomusa and
Sikhulumi had to move quickly to keep the Pygmy in
sight. If they lost him, they might not easily find their
way back to the hunters, much less find the Pygmy
settlement.</p>

<p class='c003'>Now and then the Pygmy turned to see if they
were still following. Sometimes he slowed down to allow
them to catch up with him. He was much stronger than
he looked. Although he carried a heavy load of meat,
he did not stop to rest even once.</p>

<p class='c003'>At last they came to the Pygmy settlement. When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>the other Pygmies saw Nomusa and Sikhulumi, they
stopped, looking startled. Nomusa’s Pygmy companion
said something to them, pointing to the visitors. Then
the Pygmies came forward and helped carry the smoked
meat to one of their little houses.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa saw that these huts were made of bent
branches tied together with vines. Leaves were laid
over the branches to keep out the sun and rain. The
huts were small and not carefully made. Perhaps the
Pygmies did not bother to make a better hut because
they did not stay in one place very long. The Zulu huts
were much larger and stronger, for they stayed in the
same place for years and years.</p>

<p class='c003'>Sikhulumi explained to Nomusa that the Pygmies
lived only on what wild animals they could catch and
on roots and berries found growing in the forest. The
Zulus owned cattle, and they planted their own gardens
with a wide variety of vegetables and fruits. They did
not have to wander from place to place in search of
food like the Pygmies.</p>

<p class='c003'>Their Pygmy guide now invited them to come and
see the inside of a hut. Sikhulumi decided he was too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>big to enter, but he urged Nomusa to go in. When she
crawled in through the low opening, she saw a woman,
smaller than herself, carrying a baby astride her hip.
The woman was cooking something in a black pot
over a fire. From time to time she left the hut, returning
quickly with caterpillars or winged ants, snails or
lizards. All these she threw into the pot. Once a small
boy, little more than half the size of Themba, came in
with a bush rat to put into the pot.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa observed that these people did not sleep on
mats, but on dried skins of animals, or on leaves. The
hut was empty, except for a few gourds. How different
were the Zulu huts, thought Nomusa. Since her people
stayed a long time in one place, it did not matter how
many things they collected and kept in their huts. To
people like the Pygmies, who moved often, it was important
not to have many things to carry.</p>

<p class='c003'>When Nomusa came out of the hut, she found
Sikhulumi talking to a Pygmy who knew something
of the Zulu language. He was asking Sikhulumi if he
had any salt.</p>

<p class='c003'>Sikhulumi shook his head regretfully. “If we come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>next year, we will surely bring some,” he promised.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Pygmy seemed delighted with Nomusa. He
asked her, “Are you married?”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_165.jpg' alt='[Family]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa giggled. “No, I am only ten years old.”</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>The man looked surprised. He came close to
Nomusa and measured himself against her. He was
only a tiny bit taller than she was. As he stood there
Nomusa looked with interest at a necklace he wore.
As she looked, she realized what it was. Now she knew
why the Pygmies saved the elephant’s eyelashes.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Pygmy saw her interest in the elephant-hair
necklace and quickly took it off and offered it to her.
“Bring good luck,” he said.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa looked at Sikhulumi.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Take it,” he advised. “You will have something
very unusual to show your brothers and sisters.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Sikhulumi turned to the Pygmy. “How do your
people kill elephants?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Come,” said the little man. “I will show you.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The Pygmy brought out bows and arrows as well
as slender spears so small that Nomusa thought little
Themba would have been able to use them.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa saw that the tiny arrows were made of
straight twigs of hardwood cut from a bush. The ends
of the arrows were slit and a green leaf was stuck in
each, instead of a feather such as the Zulus used.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>The man pointed to the tips of the arrows and
spears, saying, “Poison!”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Where do you get the poison?” Nomusa asked.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Pygmy explained. His people searched for
poisonous herbs as well as for poisonous barks of trees.
They also got poison from a certain black ant whose
bite was terribly painful.</p>

<p class='c003'>With many gestures, the Pygmy explained how
they climbed trees under which they expected elephants
to pass on their way to feeding grounds. The men in
the trees threw down their poisoned spears on the passing
elephants, while Pygmies on the ground shot
poisoned arrows at the animals.</p>

<p class='c003'>If the elephant did not die at once, the Pygmies
knew that some of the poison would finally work inside
the animal’s body and kill him. They would follow
him until he dropped. Usually, he assured them, they
did not have long to wait.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa was still full of curiosity. “Do the boys
take care of the cattle as my brothers do?”</p>

<p class='c003'>The Pygmy looked surprised. “We have no cattle,”
he said. “We live by hunting.”</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>“How long have you been living here?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Two moons. Soon we leave. More fruit, berries,
tortoises, and monkeys in new place.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa suddenly remembered Dube. “You like
monkeys?” she asked hopefully.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Ay, very good to eat!”</p>

<p class='c003'>It was time to go. Many of the small people came
to look at the visitors curiously. Nomusa noticed that,
like the men, the women wore no ornaments, beads,
or bracelets.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa had a final question for the Pygmy. “How
many wives do Pygmy men have?”</p>

<p class='c003'>He looked shocked, then amused. “How many?
One, of course.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Now Nomusa really felt sorry for these people. She
realized how very poor the Pygmies were, for among
the Zulus it was only a poor man who had but one wife.</p>

<p class='c003'>Their guide was ready to take them back to their
camp. The Pygmies waved a friendly farewell to their
visitors. One woman gave Nomusa a present—a huge
dried beetle, the largest Nomusa had ever seen.</p>

<p class='c003'>With no load to carry, the Pygmy guide sped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>through the forest so quickly that Nomusa and Sikhulumi
had to run to keep up with him. He no longer
bothered to look back to see if they were following.
Perhaps he thought that anyone who had been over the
ground once would surely know it again.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was close to sundown, and when the long purple
shadows of the trees fell across the ground, it became
increasingly difficult to see the Pygmy.</p>

<p class='c003'>At last what they feared had happened. Sikhulumi
stopped, completely confused. Nomusa needed no word
from him to tell her they were lost. The Pygmy was
nowhere to be seen, and they did not know which path
to take. Sihkulumi looked very anxious. Then they
heard a whistle.</p>

<p class='c003'>“It is he!” cried Nomusa. “But where?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Where, indeed? Sihkulumi looked all about him.
Then the whistle sounded again, and Sihkulumi’s
dark face broke into a grin. He raised his eyes to the high
branches of a tree. There was the Pygmy, his small body
barely discernible among the green leaves.</p>

<p class='c003'>Down he scampered, agile as a monkey. In his
hand was a big piece of honeycomb, some of which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>gave to Nomusa and Sihkulumi. They walked along
more slowly now, and together, eating the delicious
honey. But Nomusa kept a watchful eye on the Pygmy.
Perhaps he might decide to play another joke on them.</p>

<p class='c003'>But they soon reached the others, without any
difficulty. The Pygmies were still smoking elephant
meat, but the Zulu hunters had finished their work.
They squatted about the huge fire, resting and eating.
Nomusa and Sihkulumi were glad to dip their fingers
into the food pot, too.</p>

<p class='c003'>As they ate and rested, Zitu spoke.</p>

<p class='c003'>“We can be thankful that we have had a safe and
successful hunt. Tomorrow at sunrise we set out for our
kraals. Let everyone remember to take care along the
way so that we shall have no mishap.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Growing drowsy by the fire, Nomusa thought of
all the wonderful stories she had to tell Themba. And
Mdingi would be sure to make good songs about many
of the things Nomusa would tell him. Yo! She was every
bit as eager to get home as she had been to leave!</p>

<p class='c003'>Everyone was getting ready to sleep, and a sentinel
had been appointed. Nomusa looked over at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>Pygmies to see what they were doing. The night had
grown chilly, and the little men were beating their
bodies with their hands and huddling close to the fire.
Nomusa saw some Pygmies crawl inside the elephant.
She expected them to come right out again. But they
did not, and after a bit Nomusa went over to see why
they stayed so long.</p>

<p class='c003'>Inside the elephant the Pygmies lay, one next to
the other, fast asleep.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>
<img src='images/i_172.jpg' alt='[Huts]' class='ig001'>
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'><span class='fss'>SEVENTEEN</span>: The Leopard in the Pit</h2>
</div>

<p class='c002'>On the homeward trip Nomusa kept
watching for interesting birds and animals. She could
never have too many stories to tell Themba and
Umpondo and the other little brothers and sisters.</p>

<p class='c003'>When they were about a day’s journey from the
kraals, the party rested on a flat-topped hill. Looking
down on the valley, Nomusa beheld a wonderful sight.
A number of lions, lionesses, and cubs lay among the
tall grasses. The older animals seemed to be drowsing
in the sun, but the cubs refused to stay quiet. Like
kittens they played together, tumbling about, nipping
each other’s ears and tails.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>How gentle they looked, Nomusa thought, even
harmless. But she was glad to know they were far below
her and the other hunters.</p>

<p class='c003'>A small antelope appeared, a short distance away,
the lions ignored it; this was not the time for hunting.
But the lionesses growled, and their tails began to
switch. The cubs looked at the antelope, and back at
their mothers. The lionesses rushed forward with low
growls, encouraging their frolicking cubs to come
along.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Look!” said Damasi, who sat watching beside
Nomusa. “I think the lionesses are going to use the little
antelope to teach the cubs how to hunt!”</p>

<p class='c003'>A lioness kept the antelope at bay, while the cubs
worried it. Sometimes the mother let the antelope run
away, in order to see if the cubs could catch it by themselves.
When they could not, she ran it down herself
and pinned it to the ground; then she left the animal
to the cubs.</p>

<p class='c003'>One cub did not know what to do and ran wildly
about the antelope, nipping its tail playfully. The
mother rushed at her cub and smacked him with her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>paw as if to tell him to behave like a lion and not like
a baby.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_174.jpg' alt='[Lions]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa would like to have watched more, but
again the Zulus were on the march. They were in a
hurry to get home, and they rested only briefly.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the distance they could see the rolling hills on
which the kraals were situated. Nomusa was glad that
this was so, for she was very tired. How good it would
be to lie on her mat and sleep and sleep!</p>

<p class='c003'>She was not keeping up with the others very well,
but no one seemed to pay any attention. Ahead of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>she could see Damasi walking with Zabala. They
were having a good time laughing and talking together,
and Nomusa thought crossly that Damasi seemed to
have forgotten she was with them. He did not even
look back to see where she was.</p>

<p class='c003'>As she moved wearily along, Nomusa kept on
thinking of the joy of returning. How glad she would
be to see her mother and the baby sister! How she
would hug her chubby little brother! And Mdingi and
funny Kangata—</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa’s busy thoughts made her forget her
weariness, but they made her less cautious, too. If she
had been intent on where she was walking, she would
have been suspicious of the place in the trail where
some branches had fallen and the grasses were oddly
disturbed. She would have gone around it as the
others had.</p>

<p class='c003'>But Nomusa’s thoughts were far away, and the
next thing she knew she lay at the bottom of a pit, on
top of the body of a small leopard. It was dead, with
an arrow in its neck. Her first feeling was that she was
thankful the leopard was dead. But soon she realized
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>that she could not get out of the pit without help. In a
frenzy she began shouting for someone to come and
help her. How long must she stay here? Would she ever
get out? The hunters might even reach the kraals before
they knew she was missing.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa was brave, but it was dark and hot in
the pit, and she was very tired. The minutes crawled
by, and she began to feel less and less a fearless hunter
and more and more a frightened ten-year-old girl.</p>

<p class='c003'>Maybe she would never see her mother and her
brothers and sisters again. Maybe they would never
find her and never know what had happened to her.
Tears welled up in Nomusa’s eyes in spite of herself.
Again she called, this time somewhat feebly. Thirst
consumed her, and her body felt unbearably hot and
sticky. Why, oh why, had she ever wanted to be a
hunter? If only she had stayed at home this would never
have happened to her.</p>

<p class='c003'>She tried several times to make toeholds in the
sheer sides of the pit, but the soft earth crumbled away.
By now she didn’t even know what time of day it was.
It seemed ages since she had fallen into the pit. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>shuddered fearfully at the thought of being there all
night. A live animal might fall in, too; Nomusa’s vivid
imagination pictured all sorts of dreadful encounters
with snarling, clawing lions and leopards.</p>

<p class='c003'>Again she called out in desperation. And, miracle
of miracles! she heard an answering cry. She was sure
it was Damasi’s voice. “Nomusa! Where are you?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Here!” she shrieked. “In the pit! Be careful!”</p>

<p class='c003'>The leaves and branches were parted, and there
was Damasi looking down at her. Zabala was beside
him.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yo! What a scare you gave us!” Zabala cried.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Are you all right?” Damasi asked anxiously.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes,” said Nomusa, weakly. “But how frightened
I have been!” she confessed.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Who would not have been frightened?” Damasi
answered, looking awesomely at the pit.</p>

<p class='c003'>“How shall we get her out?” asked Zabala, practically.</p>

<p class='c003'>Damasi considered. For once, Nomusa had no
ideas. She was content to wait to be rescued.</p>

<p class='c003'>“We must get strong vines and weave them together,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>Damasi decided. “Then Nomusa can attach
them to herself and we can pull her out.</p>

<p class='c003'>“You will need more than one,” Nomusa said. “I
have something here that I must bring up.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“What is that?” Zabala inquired.</p>

<p class='c003'>“You shall see,” Nomusa said mysteriously.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_178.jpg' alt='[Children]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Before long Damasi threw down two lengths of
woven vines. Nomusa tested them and found them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>strong. One she bound securely about the leopard; the
other she knotted under her arms. “Ready!” she called.</p>

<p class='c003'>Zabala and Damasi braced themselves firmly and
pulled with all their might. Nomusa held on tightly
and dug her toes into the sides of the pit. Right now
she wished they were long like the Pygmy’s!</p>

<p class='c003'>At last she was over the top of the pit and lay on
the ground breathing hard. Damasi and Zabala looked
at her with concern, touching her to be sure she was
all right.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Now the other,” Nomusa said, finally, still panting.</p>

<p class='c003'>This time the pull was easier, for there were three
of them. Nomusa could not wait to see their faces when
the leopard appeared.</p>

<p class='c003'>“<em>Hau!</em>” the boys cried at the same time. “A
leopard!”</p>

<p class='c003'>They were still exclaiming over the handsome
beast when Zitu and Sihkulumi and another hunter
came running up. How relieved her father was to
see Nomusa!</p>

<p class='c003'>When he heard what had happened, Zitu looked
at Zabala and Damasi proudly.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>“You have done well,” the chief said. “No man
could have done better.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa looked timidly at her father. “I am sorry,
my father. My carelessness has caused you much
trouble.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Zitu nodded. “Some of the fault was yours,” he
agreed. “But I am to blame, too. In my eagerness to
return home I did not look for you as I should have.
Come,” Zitu added gently. “We shall stop for the
night when we reach the others. It is too late to go on.”</p>

<p class='c003'>He directed the men to tie the leopard’s legs to
their spears and carry him back to the camp.</p>

<p class='c003'>“The beast is yours,” her father said to Nomusa.
“You may do what you want with him.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa’s heart was so full of joy and relief that
she forgot her weariness. How wonderful to be free to
walk again! And her father was not angry with her.
Surely no girl ever had so much to be thankful for.</p>

  <h2 class='c009'><span class='fss'>EIGHTEEN</span>: The Song Of Mdingi</h2>
</div>

<p class='c002'>As the hunters approached the kraal,
those who had remained behind rushed out to meet
them. The four huge ivory tusks were exclaimed over
and admired.</p>

<p class='c003'>“These are the finest tusks I have ever seen,” said
an old man, touching them with his hand. “They will
be worth much in exchange.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa ran forward to greet her mother and to
hug Themba joyously and dance him up and down.</p>

<p class='c003'>“What stories I have to tell you, Themba! And
here is a present for you,” Nomusa added, putting the
large beetle the Pygmy woman had given her into
his fat little hands.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>Sisiwe squeezed through the crowds, carrying
Dube on her shoulder. The little monkey looked frightened
at the crowds of people and the noise. Had he
forgotten her, Nomusa wondered? She greeted Sisiwe
affectionately and then spoke to Dube.</p>

<p class='c003'>At the sound of her voice, Dube was all aquiver.
When he saw her he strained forward. With one
leap he was in Nomusa’s arms, chattering “Tchirk?
Tchirk?” as if to ask her why she had stayed away
so long.</p>

<p class='c003'>“He still loves you best,” Sisiwe said, a little sadly.</p>

<p class='c003'>“But you may play with him as often as you want,”
Nomusa said. “I shall not forget what good care you
have taken of him, my sister.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa soon realized that she was indeed at home,
for she heard her mother calling from their hut.
“Nomusa! Fetch water!”</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/i_183.jpg' alt='[Children]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c003'>As she walked to the stream she was followed by
a crowd of girls, all suddenly having to fetch water
for their mothers. Nomusa was kept busy answering
dozens of questions. The girls were especially interested
in hearing about the Pygmies, and they laughed uproariously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>when Nomusa told about the Pygmy who
had asked her if she was married.</p>

<p class='c003'>It took much longer than usual to fetch water on
this exciting day. By the time they returned, everyone
was busy preparing for the evening feast in celebration
of the successful hunt and the safe return of the hunters.</p>

<p class='c003'>A huge stack of brushwood was being piled up
outside the kraal to make a fire. Over this fire a bullock
would be roasted, together with mealie cobs. Soon
Nomusa’s brothers began returning from the pasture
with their mothers’ cows. They had to return earlier
today to help with the preparations for the evening.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa rushed to greet her brothers. “Oh, Mdingi,
Kangata, how much I have to tell you! Put the cows
in the cattlefold and hurry back!”</p>

<p class='c003'>Soon her brothers sat beside Nomusa while she
told about the snake that had swallowed the spotted
deer, the fascinating Pygmies, the lions she had seen,
and finally of her adventure in the pit. Her brothers
listened, spellbound.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Think if the leopard had been alive!” Kangata
said, frightened at the very thought.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>Nomusa smiled at him. “Here is a present for you,
Kangata,” she said. “The Pygmy told me this elephant-hair
necklace would bring the wearer good luck.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Kangata put on the necklace, marveling at Nomusa’s
generosity. Mdingi rose.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Your stories are exciting, my sister,” he said. “I
want to hear more soon. But now I must milk our
mother’s cows.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Wait—come with me to the hut first,” Nomusa
said. “I have something for you, too.”</p>

<p class='c003'>When they got to the hut, Nomusa picked up the
leopard skin, which she had asked Sihkulumi to remove
carefully for her. She handed it to Mdingi.</p>

<p class='c003'>The skin was a very beautiful one, and Mdingi
was speechless with happiness.</p>

<p class='c003'>“It is too much,” he managed to say, finally.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I am happy to give it to you,” Nomusa answered
softly. She was very glad it pleased him so much, because
she knew how sad he had felt about not going
on the elephant hunt.</p>

<p class='c003'>Mdingi continued to gaze at his treasure and feel
it with his fingers.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>“I have another present for you,” Nomusa added.
“It is a different kind of present, but maybe you can
use it.” She told him the story of the wounded elephant
that had attacked Sihkulumi and of their father’s
courage and daring.</p>

<p class='c003'>“If I could make songs, like you,” Nomusa said
to her brother, “I should make a great song about this.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Mdingi’s face had a kind of shining look that
Nomusa had seen before. She thought he was seeing
in his mind the heroic scene Nomusa had described to
him, and the words of a song were already clamoring
to be spoken.</p>

<p class='c003'>Mdingi turned to go, clutching the leopard skin
to him. “Thank you, Nomusa!” he said. “Thank you,
thank you!”</p>

<p class='c002'>The African moon shone big and full and yellow.
The outlines of trees were dark against the sky, and
the leaping flames of the fire danced higher and higher.</p>

<p class='c003'>The people had eaten and drunk all they could
hold, and now they sat in a great circle around the fire,
listening as different singers chanted stories about the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>great Zulu hunters and warriors. Most of the stories
had been told over and over, but the people always
wanted to hear them again.</p>

<p class='c003'>Only Nomusa was not surprised when Mdingi
stood up and walked out into the open space. Facing
his people, he began to sing in a clear strong voice:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<em>High in the hills roams the mighty elephant, lord of the forest;</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>The trees quiver as he passes, and the earth trembles under his terrible feet.</em>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>His father looked astonished as Mdingi went on,
telling of the preparations for the elephant hunt, the
great care the chief took for the safety of his men. A
teller of tales was greatly to be admired, and Zitu had
not realized that his son possessed such talents.</p>

<p class='c003'>All the people listened eagerly, and Nomusa’s heart
swelled with pride in her brother. How thrilling it was
to hear the story told so eloquently! Everyone was tense
with excitement as Mdingi sang of Sihkulumi,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<em>the hunter with eyes like an eagle,</em>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>who had first seen the wounded elephant in the gathering
dusk. Knowing no fear, the hunter had leaped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>forward. But the vengeful elephant had only feigned
death, and attacked the hunter.</p>

<p class='c003'>Then came the heroic climax, and Mdingi did it
full justice in his song. When he finished, the people
cheered the singer loudly. They shouted, “<i><span lang="zu">Hau! Hau!</span></i>”
for their brave and kind leader. Yo! It was a day long
to be remembered.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_188.jpg' alt='[Family]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>Mdingi stood beside Zitu, and his father’s hand
rested on the boy’s shoulder affectionately. Zitu beckoned
to Nomusa.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Come, my little hunter!” he said. “I think perhaps
it was you who brought such good luck to all of us!”</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa’s face flushed with pride and embarrassment
as she listened to her father’s praise. She was glad
when she could slip back among the others.</p>

<p class='c003'>Now Damasi stood beside her, smiling. “Is this
not a wonderful celebration?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa agreed it was indeed.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I see Mdingi is wearing a new leopard skin,”
Damasi went on, softly. “And Kangata has a necklace
of elephant hair. Did you keep anything for yourself?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Nomusa shook her head. “I do not need anything.
After all, I had the hunt.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Perhaps you will find new trophies on next year’s
hunt,” suggested Damasi.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, I shall not go next year!” Nomusa said.
“Next year Mdingi will go.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Damasi looked at her keenly. “Perhaps that is
best,” he admitted. “But I don’t think Mdingi will bring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>back a greater story, no matter how many hunts he
goes on.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, it <em>was</em> wonderful!” Nomusa cried. “It is true
that nothing could be more exciting than that elephant
hunt.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The fire was dying down, but its flames still illumined
Nomusa’s small, dark, eager face. Damasi looked
at her in silence. He was thinking that life would always
be interesting and exciting to Nomusa.</p>
